Conservative,"i personally am not but what i ussually hear and i understand it completely is everything the government gets involved in turns to shit has miles of red tape is wasteful and inefficient  there are also complexities with moral issues such as the government funding abortions genital mutiliation etc and people dont want their tax money going to that

now i personally believe those those are mostly are true of insurance as well and id rather have the us government which doesnt have an incentive for income like a private company would be a more cost effective option for the tax payeralso the fact that literally every other western nation has it and on top of that the us spends more on healthcare per capita then almost all of those nations and we get less  i really do think there is a bit of a turning point on the healthcare conversation as even young conservatives who are aware of the world are starting to see healthcare differently especially once they have families  most employers cover the employee healthcare but when you add families in it gets expensive extremely quick"
Conservative,"the real question is how do i know those taxes are actually going to the healthcare provider and not back into the military industrial complex this is one of the issues i have and why i am skeptical of a lot of the taxation based on this and it is also why i believe that the government is not the solution to all of your problems same can be said about social security i believe it is supposed to be a temporary solution to get you back on your feet not something you overtly rely on the only exception would be if you are actually physically disabled

i would support a model like switzerland where they have their own health insurance and pay for their own healthcare plus switzerland has some of the best healthcare in the world

the only way i would support universal healthcare is if i have complete oversight on the taxation and can make sure it actually goes towards the service and not back into the military industrial complex

in short i would rather trust a company that i can actually get to know and not the government government is not the solution to all of your problems it is there to maintain law and order"
Conservative,im not opposed to a universal system were very close to that already im generally opposed to a singlepayer system because i dont think its the best way to adopt a universal system
Conservative,"why put a bandaid on an artery bleed without addressing the artery universal healthcare will just try to throw money at a problem then the healthcare system will grow and require more money as it seems government funded as endless well of money just like the military industrial complex

how about we figure out why we have allowed a secretive cartel like healthcare system that doesnt have any pricing for medical services until after the fact and there is no way to get those prices a pharmaceutical system that allows both the makers and middlemen that are in complete conflict of interest pbm and allows them to jack up prices for meds well over a thousand times manufacturing costs"
Conservative,"i dont trust the federal government running those kind of things i prefer to be able to choose my own health insurance

  
that being said i think that if an state wants to provide uch then let them i see no reason why california shouldnt do it i aint going anywhere near that state in the future so i dont care"
Conservative,what if the government funded healthcare but it was administered by private companies
Conservative,there is currently a shortage of  doctors specialists nurses and hospitals free healthcare for all would be a disaster  the government fucks up everything they touch thats why
Conservative,my concern is we will end up with a system similar to canada where people wait months for diagnostic procedures and then wait months or longer for treatment on top of that they have medically assisted suicide which when the state controls healthcare creates a serious moral issue in my opinion it saves the state money if you are just willing to off yourself if you are living with debilitating pain on a waitlist for treatment you may just decide that is the best option does not sound very human forward to me
Conservative,the instant you put government money on anything the way its spent becomes a matter of public opinion thats not something i want tied to healthcare as a whole
Conservative,"this is the classic liberal approach of my solution is perfect and anyone who disagrees is a bad person  how would this work exactly  who knows  if youre liberal you can just imagine that your solution works and anyone who questions it is smeared as hating the poor

we have federally sponsored healthcare for veterans and its a massive boondoggle  its inefficient and doesnt have the best outcomes  if you applied that to all americans wed be bankrupt

if you put 18 of the us gdp which is what healthcare represents into the hands of a small group of unelected bureaucrats wed have unimaginable levels of corruption and graft

as it stands the biden admin reimburses doctors at higher rates if they embrace dei policies  not for being better doctors but for being woke"
Conservative,"the specifics matter  i dont support a national system because there is entirely too much variance nationally and its too big to not grift

at the state level i think it would be doable  there are a lot of opinions on how it should be funded and what it should look like  this would allow the people to implement systems they find most agreeable to their locality

its too bad that every time the bill comes up for vote to allow the states to do this that it dies in committee"
Conservative,"its economics in order to keep prices low you need competition and in the case of insurance that competition must be to have no insurance aka pay out of pocket when everyone is forced to have it you essentially create a monopoly bc you have eliminated the primary competition 

secondly its not moral imo to force people to pay for a service they dont want who am i or who is the government to say i must purchase something costing 20k instead of using that money the way i see fit if i want to take the risk of not being insured and invest that money put it in a 401k or even use it for college or rent or food then why shouldnt i have that option most people under 40 rarely use insurance and 50k invested in these early years would become hundreds of thousands by the time you reach your 50s this harms more people than it helps and if that option keeps insurance and medical costs low then its a logically positive result on the world  which is better everyone having insurance that only some use or most people having an extra few hundred thousand for their retirement"
Conservative,"i pay enough in taxes for no rewards just wastei dont need to add fuel to the fire and bring more


ever been to a postal office or an rmv those are 2 reasons i dont want the government in healthcare anymore than they already are


not to mention hospitals here in massachusetts are a joke ever since mass health was implemented everyone goes for stubbing their toe and they dont care cause they have to pay for it while people with actual ailments wait 29 hours in er for a bed actually happened


im all set with it"
Conservative,deleted
Conservative,"1 i dont buy that taxes instead of insurance would decrease my costs or even offset them a lot  insurance rates largely get set based on the pool of insurees and theres a lot of people who arent in my insurance pool who have pretty expensive health care needs
2 im worried the government would respond to high costs by effectively making lessnecessary stuff unavailable  right now im actually spending a lot of the insurance companys money on adjuvant immunotherapy  as far as we know the surgery got all the melanoma out but the immunotherapy is just in case theres any little bits of metastasis that we dont know about yet  i also have to get pet scans an mris a few times a year to keep tabs on it  i could see a costconscious bureaucrat decide that the government could save money by canceling both of those and just pay for maid when they find out is has spread  heck im afraid of the insurance companies doing that too but the threat of bad pr scares them more than the government
3 similarly but maybe paradoxically im worried about the government covering things for other people that im not sure are necessary  that kinda reinforces number 2 though  im not a doctor so i really shouldnt be telling you what is or isnt medically necessary but im also a voter and a taxpayer so if youre spending my money on it im gonna get involved"
Conservative,we cant afford it and it is a down grade for healthcare
Conservative,"for those who are why are you personally opposed to universal healthcare

because we have so many other major issues im not convinced a universal healthcare system can work for a variety of issues one of which is we are on of the sickest most unhealthy societies ever 

we already spend as much or more than most people from the government level lets see if theres inefficiencies and places we can lower that cost and see what happens before we fundamentally restructure everything 

if our government could do universal healthcare why hasnt the va done any better why wont our universal healthcare look just like the va

youre okay with letting a kid potentially die because the choices their parents made 

you are too thats how the world works one parent drives recklessly and killed their kids in the backseat its not great but its preferable to the alternative of barring people from driving theres a certain amount of risk involved in living thats just the way it is 

this argument doesnt land with me yes i want a system where that child get the care they need i simply dont agree the solution is universal healthcare 

idk i cant seem to see a rational argument against universal healthcare that doesnt originate from the large companies selling the health insurance

why do any rd and spend the hundreds of millions it takes to create new drugs if you cant make money off of it theyre not gonna do it out of the niceness of their heart human nature hasnt changed

if universal healthcare as a system works then a state should be able to do it themselves make it work and make us all look like idiots and then can say we told you so"
Conservative,the idea is great the government is utterly incapable of running it efficiently
Conservative,no such thing as a free mealz the government provided resources already provided are dreadful could you imagine if everyone has access to them yes the raise in taxes and waiting time also play in effect
Conservative,removed
Conservative,it would be a financially dumb thing for me to support while i am young by all proposals i would be paying at least 2x more not accounting for how they wouldnt provide enough funding and more tax revenue would be necessary than my current private healthcare through my employer
Conservative,im not i just think we should explore free market solution to make healthcare affordable before we give the government the power to determine who gets what single payer is a long term commitment with a lot of downsides that are handwaved away by its supports it may be that single payer is the best way forward
Conservative,removed
Conservative,removed
Conservative,"im not against universal healthcare but i do have a problem with how little financial acumen that most people have when they are proposing it that and how very little they actually want to talk about healthcare administration they think that they can just rubber stamp one idea and feel proud of themselves and not actually think about cohesive public policy 

for example as an africanamerican woman the first thought that comes to mind when you say universal healthcare is that you want to add 40 million people to an expectation of primary physician care but it takes 11 years to train a doctor and black america is 14 of america but only 5 of doctors as is same stats for hispanic are we going to have a conversation about addressing racism in healthcare about how we are substantially increasing demand with no way to equally increase supply and to ensure it is quality care 

because again im not saying i oppose it im saying liberals should be happy to talk about the wicked problems a real socioeconomic term their policies address instead they usually get huffy and bring up clich examples like the ones in the op post that simplify healthcare to dont you care about kids i do do you care about black women who are tired of racism and sexism in healthcare or about a greater diversity of healthcare practitioners md od nurse practitioners etc

the best conversation that i have ever had with someone about this involved them proposing that more emergency care doctors go back to school to become primary physicians but they didnt actually know the population of er doctors and so their pipe dream was based on an assumption that theres hundreds of thousands of er doctors just waiting to become general care yeah there are only 50000

furthermore looking at the issue geographically giving everyone greater financial access to healthcare doesnt change the number of doctors willing to live in west virginia so that west virginians have doctors 

my primary industries are food and housing and if liberals behave the same way about how they gather and use statistics for doctors as they do for food i can list about three common logical fallacies that they would continue to perpetuate in order to inaccurately measure and describe what discrepancies are happening in healthcare 

and i have yet to talk to someone that is willing to say that they would be happy to address these discrepancies 

they just wanna ask me dont i care about the children"
Conservative,i am opposed to most government involvement and i am especially against mandated services not all people want to pay for health coverage some just want to do ala cart as they need it
Conservative,im a dual us german citizen living in the us but i have livedworked in both in germany the salaries even worse in spain are lower than the us which sucks with the high taxes but to me the worst was scarcity of things like mri equipment and having wait months to get one for my family now i prefer paying for my own health insurance
Conservative,"wrong tool for the job  you wouldnt want to cut down a tree with a hammer it wouldnt solve the problems we have in the usa or make anything less expensive everyone would more forced through taxation to pay for the hordes of illegal immigrants who have recently and currently made their way into the usa the drugfentanyl epidemic we are currently dealing with thanks to mexico and the fallout of the covid lockdowns  george floyd riots as well as way too many americans having diabetes or heart disease from hyperconsumerism and technologybigtech

the issues are mostly an issue of supply and demand and the current system we have being riddled with inefficiencyinsuranceliability issues health care was less expensive and of higher quality before obamacare for the usa more transparency and competition less liability concerns for healthcare professionals more efficiency as well as addressing the root causes would be best"
Conservative,"1 the demand for healthcare will skyrocket making it prohibitively expensive meaning the government will very quickly have to make dramatic cuts to the program to keep it afloat 
2 incentivizes bad habits due to people no longer having to pay for their own mistakes
3 people will start going to the doctor for trifles see number 1
4 every waiting room will be like the dmv on a monday or an inner city er on a saturday night 
5 the care will suck with doctors trying to get you in and out as fast as possible 
6 only the cheapest tests drugs and therapies will be permitted see number 1 again"
Conservative,"i became convinced that universal healthcare would be a disaster after serving in the military and seeing first hand how government run healthcare really operated when you serve on active duty you get tricare tricare is free to all active duty members and it is run by the us government the care was disasterous all i got were long wait times sometimes six months to see a doctor lazy half assed care when i did eventually get to the doctor like throwing ibuprofen at me while not even trying to figure out the underlying issue and there is a reason for this active duty military docs get paid the same no matter the amount of work they do so there is very little incentive to actually strive to be a decent medical professional they are are there because the military paid back their medical school loans if they commited to a certain amount of years of service so a lot of them sit back and relax while living off of the government for 45 years biding their time until they can get out and go get a job in the private sector where they can make a whole hell of a lot more

military members are only about one percent of the us population our government has enough trouble trying to take care of the one percent of the populace that is also our fighting force imagine if we took 350 million people and put them all on a system like that the amount of people that would die waiting for care would be out of control

not to mention from an economic standpoint eliminating competition would drive premiums through the roof competition is what keeps prices down

now i am not a defender of the medical establishment i know they have their own problems i just dont believe a socialist system would improve anything at all only the opposite"
Conservative,i have zero interest in concentrating any more power in government than already exists my rationalization is government power leads to cronyism and corruption and slowskills innovation
Conservative,removed
Conservative,there is no such thing as universal healthcare there are only so many doctors and nurses and hospital beds i would rather take all of the deliberate bottlenecks and government intrusions out of the healthcare industry i would be surprised if there were still an issue with the system after that
Conservative,removed
Conservative,anything rationed by the government becomes politically corrupted read preference given to votes and inefficiently operated the outcome of universal care means my tax money directed preferentially to those who serve the politicians wishes  although our medical system has significant problems id rather direct my health care dollars to nonpolitical entities as believe that i can gain the health care services i need better through existing systems than that which a bureaucratic government third party introduced in the middle would enable
Conservative,"im open to the idea and opposed to the current proposals id rather see price transparency and allowing for interstate plans read reforming the current system before tossing it away

 for starters there is no fundamental right to healthcare per the tenth amendment healthcare is the states domain not even california could get that passed show me a us state successfully running that kind of program and youll have my support 
 i would be more supportive of the notion if there were goodfaith approaches to pass an amendment giving us the right to healthcare only a universal system can follow in that case 
 i dont believe democrats when they say costs will stay the same for the average family or that theyll go down either taxes will increase or inflation will most likely both 
 in theory the bottleneck for a free market is the individuals ability to pay i can go into debt for medical care or choose to let things go a universal system is similarly bottlenecked only at the federal level when the system reaches its budget constraints then it makes the decision for me on whether to go into debt or let things go
 democrats are operating on the theory that american citizens will make better health decisions with universal care i highly doubt that i think it will get worse whats the incentive to take better care of myself when the costs associated with that are highly diffuse
 having universal healthcare is not going to take away the fact we have sugar and corn syrup in everything our portions are huge that we have extremely easy access to unhealthy fast food and thats its a lot easier to find groceries of poor nutritious value than good it opens the door to a lot more government control sin taxes etc 
 i previously worked for a global medical company you dont get a choice in your specific medical treatments a government bureaucrat negotiates that with marketing managers at the supplying companies the company may offer a lowcost option but too bad some government group decides that you get the pricier option that gives the same results oh the government must also approve the company as a legitimate option i knew of one ukbased company that was running medical trials in the us because the nhs wouldnt consider their device without actual clinical evidence sounds like a catch 22 doesnt it
 per the last point heres a more specific example courtesy of rgerd if you present with acid reflux disease then the first thing your gi doctor will do is perform an upper endoscopy thats where they slide a camera down your throat and into your stomach take some pictures and collect some biopsies the standard of care in the us is to do the procedure under conscious sedation with a drug like propofol not only do you sleep through the whole thing you likely have no memory you could elect out of sedation and either go in with nothing or with a throat numbing spray and endure an extremely unpleasant 510 minutes but thats your prerogative as of a couple years ago in the uk yes im picking on them again there was no option of conscious sedation you got the throat numbing spray and that was that it was common to see ukposters lament about a failed endoscopy which means that they gagged andor vomited so much on the endoscope that they had to abort the procedure and reschedule could you imagine
 last the individual is no longer the one making the medical decisions but ultimately its the government that doesnt just apply to you but to your children as well what they say goes and theyll take you to court and sue to have life support removed even though there are doctors in other countries willing to take the case"
Conservative,"aside from the horrendous inefficiencies of anything that can be controlled by the government i personally do not want any more of a connection between my healthcare and big brother

it isnt too much or a stretch to say that your religious beliefs political affiliation or bad habits could be accessible or connected to your social 

its a bit more improbable but still possible that you could be punished based on other factors didnt pay your taxes you have to wait for that operation

what if the healthcare budget is tight you get the c grade doctors while the best ones go into private practice and before you could have afforded them because of your insurance but now theres no way because its too expensive

just look at how messed up canada is with their recommendations of suicide instead of working to resolve fixable issues and what if you had no money to get another opinion

im actually okay with the government stepping in when costs get out of control and insurance wont cover things but that is not most peoples experience regardless of how big of a problem it can be for those people and yes i have a lot of empathy for that situation"
Conservative,im not opposed to it because i understand it as a goal not any specific policy
Conservative,i dont want to pay for obese people or otherwise people who decided to make bad decisions with their lives
Conservative,against it because im concerned at how frighteningly large the countrys expenditures are
Conservative,removed
Conservative,im not against universal healthcare im against single payer
Conservative,"im not opposed to it what i am is realistic about actual savings and efficiency gains for the kinds of changes anyone is willing to implement and to reiterate before i tear down every surfacelevel argument for it i am in favor of universal healthcare it just has to be done intelligently and with realistic expectations in mind and given political momentum the time to do it right is the first time rather than try to overhaul it later

confusion of terms leads to contradictory arguments

for example the primary methods proposed are fundamentally different forms of national health insurance there are a few ways this can work  either as a sole payer as a partial payer as the sole insurance as providing a baseline coverage but upgraded or elective coverage is private insurance as a public option as simply the bottom tier option for the poor to close up the poverty gap etc and because there are many ways it can work youll often hear proponents make contradictory arguments such as 1 that the efficiency gains of dealing with only one insurance broker the state will save massive amounts of money and 2 that you can keep your current insurance sanders plan at least acknowledges this by making accepting state or private insurance mutually exclusive but most people arguing it dont see the inherent contradiction

apples must be compared to apples or at a minimum you must paint and orange to look like one

theyll also compare us to other countries and say our healthcare is overpriced  its not overpriced its expensive primarily due to baumols cost disease driving up wages for healthcare employees things in america will simply be more expensive including healthcare  if you believe people are being overcharged for a subpar product you have the power to start your own healthcare company most of them operate well into the red primarily due to medicare patients so of you can find a model to cut healthcare costs at all much less in half like people who compare us to switzerland because its the most expensive in europe and must thus be the most any country actually has to spend you have a billion dollar idea that everyone will be clambering to copy and will bring you national fame so go do it

things cost what they cost regardless of whos paying for them 

theyll point to medicare at all as being more efficient  and it does on paper after adjusting for the risk of its patient pool pay about 20 less than private expenditures what youll realize if you work in a hospital however is that they achieve this by simply not paying that 20  on a per procedure basis they only pay around 80 of the cost of the patients care and again if hospitals could find a way to cut costs such that medicare could cover these patients there wouldnt be 23 of hospitals in the red on these patients it wouldnt need to be subsisidized by private insurance which pays on average 143 the cost and instead youd see hospitals raking it in because now insurance covers 160 of costs and medicare breaks even 

a reasonable cost estimate for a singlepayer system is something like the following

1 the per patient cost of existing medicare patients

2 the per patient cost of private patients accounting for them potentially using it more now that everything is covered so more 

3 the per patient cost of the gaps  those too poor to even have time to apply for medicare those in the poverty cliff between too rich to get medicare and not in a full time job to get private insurance etc all of which are probably as expensive or more expensive than medicare patients

4 adjusted to cover the actual cost of providing care with that cost being adjusted to cover the fixed costs associated with having more patients  things like utilities facilities and staff remember healthcare has very high burnout so you need to both get more staff for more patients more staff to have all staff work fewer hours and also pay them more in general each one of those driving up the salary 

and yes we do get some efficiency gains on the administrative side from only dealing with one insurance provider but thats also not a universal feature of all national health insurance systems and also nowhere near the whole shortfall even if we dont account for any higher expenditures from more coverage this is what we call dynamic projection and the failure to do so is why the la millionaire tax didnt meet its goals while the massachusetts one did

the most egregious example ive seen is the idea that we dont need to raise taxes at all we just need to stop paying private insurance at all and use existing medicaremedicaid budget and it will cover everyone because they already pay more than the uk per patient so we should be able to pay even less because of efficiency of scale something only people not actually in logistics think of as a universal truth"
Conservative,"if you take away emotive use of children your points are substantially weaker

i support universal healthcare for children because everything true of an adult that they can make different life choices to improve their circumstances can move can reorganize their life to make more money or spend less etc are not true of children

for adults it is a moral issue if you are not responsible for your own needs you are not a free man you are a slave slaves and children are kept adults take care of themselves  i dont like much of her work but i live by rands quote i swear by my life and love of it i will live for the sake of no other man nor ask him to live for mine"
Conservative,"my rationalization against public healthcare is a combination of many things but if i had to select the most important one i would say because the current american healthcare system is fundamentally a consequence of government intervention

for example up until around 1920 private healthcare in america in britain was very cheap physicians were arranged for societies and unions by fraternal organizations where they signed lodge practice contracts this encouraged a lot of competition and thus dramatically lowered the cost of medical expenses prior to 1920 a factory workers daily wage covered their medical expenses for an entire year additionally there was a clear incentive structure so evolving and funding research was not an issue 

what changed and ultimately caused the prices to go up was the government granting associations like the ama enormous control over medical licensing if a doctor tried to sign a lodge practice they were at risk of being sanctioned by these associations to diminish competition even more the ama made it more difficult to obtain a medical license such as increasing the admission standards for med school and requiring a state licensing exam 

what inspired this change was probably the flexner report published by abraham flexner in 1910 which critiqued the status of medical education in america one of those critiques being the amount of doctors being allowed into the practice a lot of physicians trained by academically elite schools agreed with flexner i would argue most of their intentions were noble for wanting to increase the quality of medicine but the effects has led to what we have today way less affordable healthcare 

if private contracts were restored between doctors and patients as well as dialing back the influence those associations have on medical licensing i would expect a more effective rebound to a more affordable healthcare system than what public healthcare or welfare programs could provide additionally more power is not being pooled to the government and doctors and scientist are still incentivized to do research"
Conservative,removed
Conservative,"i use iehp medical program in san bern county ca and i go to a huge really nice hospital for my prenatal visits the care is outstanding there is no delaywaiting and i walk in and walk out without having to grab my wallet to me its phenomenal im not against universal healthcare at all i wish everyone had access to it not just low income elderly and disabled of course people can have the choice to go for something else like kaiser or something i cant afford kaiser myself but i heard their care is good 

doctor visits medication procedures and treatment shouldnt cost as much as it does though"
Conservative,"i dont trust the state to take care of me 

the same people that wanted to force covid vaccination lockdowns vaccine passports etc on the folks who didnt take the jab would also be running a universal healthcare system 

also i dont genuinely believe that it would perform better than a free market healthcare system with little regulation  but even if it wasnt more efficient price wise id rather give up more money than allow people that hate me to administer my healthcare more than they already do"
Conservative,"the government is terrible at setting prices   when there are different insurance companies as well as people paying cash then the hospitals and care providers set prices   with a government single payer system its the government who sets prices   

when prices are set too high you get an overabundance of a specific product or service which is inefficient   when prices are set too low you get scarcity   the government with every price becoming a political issue it is virtually impossible for them to set prices effectively   so youll have a mix of overabundance and scarcity across healthcare

market pricing is the only truly effective means of setting prices weve found which reduces overabundance and scarcity simultaneously"
Conservative,removed
Conservative,"your taxes go up sure but now your employer doesnt pay for insurance and you dont have to pay for insurance and that can offset that a lot

for what its worth this only applied to socialized medicine not universal healthcare in general"
Conservative,removed
Conservative,"how quickly the lefts mask slipped during covid going from healthcare is a human right to deny healthcare to the undesirables in the blink of an eye killed any support i had for universal healthcare


if youre dependant on the goverment for healthcare the government can use it against you"
Conservative,"i dont want anyone to go destitute but i dont think you can just ignore the laws of supply and demand

therefore im against universal healthcare but not necessarily against a form of universal insurance for catastrophic things like for example getting brain cancer things that are basically inelastic in demand and would wipe people out

the way most car insurance works is that in only kicks in when theres an unexpected accident not everyone will need to actually use it but it doesnt cover routine expected things like gas tires repairs etc otherwise it would be cost prohibitive and untenable  just like universal healthcare i think people should be responsible for the routine medical costs that are associated with life pull your weight for yourself employers and private providers can provide products for this but i have no problem with govt funded insurance for highcost inelastic tragedies"
Conservative,"nothing youre suggesting increases healthcare services you are only suggesting increasing the demand end of the equation by pumping massive amounts of money into the pockets of those in need of healthcare

by increasing demand without any increase in supply with only lead to inflation andor rationing of services we will all be fighting over the same scarce services if you do not think money is the differentiator between who gets services and who does not then what is sorry but without an increase in production it is impossible to allocate what does not exist

also taxes will progressively hit those making more money with a much much higher burden i have 3 kids and these new taxes would not care about how i provide for an entire family

in conclusion the price for healthcare would go way up for me and services would suffer greatly as we see in essentially every universal healthcare system

i would prefer singapores system where i and everyone else is forced to pay into their own health savings account then there is a very barebones state sponsored health care this keeps incentives mostly in check"
Conservative,"im not opposed to it morally i just have practical concerns 

my biggest concern is actually the physical size of the usa lots of the countries with the best uhc that american leftists tend to idolize are very small with dense populations it would be very very easy for this to just be a way to funnel money into large cities while leaving people in rural america behind the government controlling your healthcare could also lead to political strong arming in the future which i would like to avoid at all costs 

my main problem is that leftist politicians tend to say were gonna do the thing and then never put forth any plan on how to actually do that i cant support such a drastic change when i dont even know what im voting for but a well thought out and explained uhc policy is not something im opposed to"
Conservative,"i dont think the quality will decline and the cost savings will never show up the cost projections for medicare and medicaid were wildly underestimated none of the cost savings that were to happen with obamacare happened the medicare doc fix never worked out the way this government spends and the huge deficits and debts are testimony that they are totally unable to contain spending

meanwhile  people on medicaid have worse health outcomes than the uninsured the va system is very spotty and many people on medicare have trouble finding a doctor"
Conservative,i dont think the government should be allowed to have monopolies on inelastic goods
Conservative,"it doesnt address the underlying issues making healthcare so expensive 

its hard to shop around for prices because hospital prices are so buried and obscured 

theres a large administrative burden for the many hospitals that are multiple times that of other countries and im not convinced universal healthcare would fix that

certificate of need laws literally make it illegal to build a hospital unless you get permission from the other hospitals in the area great for competition s

there is a huge barrier of entry to the pharma industry leading to very little competition there 

the fda is incentivized to take as long as possible to release drugs to not be responsible for poorly performing problematic released drugs which leads to more pharmaceutical administrative costs and a really long time before drugs can be available 

the number of doctors is artificially limited by funding for residencies leading to a limited supply of doctors 

to be clear i think there are potential configurations of universal healthcare that would be better than our current system i better set of incentives etc but it doesnt solve many of the issues that lead to the problems in the system i am open to the existence of some sort of universal healthcare that i would support vote for 

my ideal health care system would involve a much better mix of the free market and competition but with the necessary regulation for such an important area of influence on your health and life currently we have some of the worst mixes of the negatives of both excessive regulation and free markets"
Conservative,"so first off at least in texas hospitals cannot refuse medical treatment due to lack of insurance so no ones dying you go to the er with life threatening whatever they will do whatever they can regardless of insurance status no one wants their kids friend to die those kind of emotional arguments tho can be counterintuitive to your cause tho so i caution you on that

what i personally support is not universal healthcare but not employer based either i think it should be like car insurance we all buy our own but maintain medicare  medicaid for those who cannot purchase their own

the reason why i dont want the gov to run it is the beaurocratic  red tape that comes along with it and its always a broken system that ends up inflating prices because the companies servicing are all trying to get their piece of the pie if you keep govt subsidies out capitalism and competition keeps pricing reasonable at what the market will bear obviously this still needs guardrails tho and thats where legislation makes sense
  open enrollment all the time for any reason
  no penalties for preexisting conditions
  family plans can be any ages grandma thru infant and up to reasonable number of people dont max out at something dumb like 4
  anyone can opt for medicare for any reason at anytime

its not that republicans are opposed to people getting healthcare thats a huge myth lefties tell eachother were opposed to the govt effing something else up"
Conservative,i dont see whats in it for me
Conservative,"other countries are more cost effective but i am not sure every other western country has better health care  thats a complicated subject because there are a lot of metrics you can use and each metric is affected by factors other than whether healthcare is universal or not

also the government may not have the same economic incentives but they have a lot more political incentives

i am not saying i am totally against it  i am not fundamentally opposed to it  but i do believe its a complicated subject and the answer isnt as easy as most people make it out to be  i certainly think its worthy of research"
Conservative,"i think the us has a cultural tendency to expect government programs or infrastructure to work as seamless efficient and profitably as a private company if they dont then they are trash 

the post office is a group example i can write an address on a mellon slap some stamps on and it will be picked up from my house and delivered to someone in ca will will take longer and be bruised absolutely than if i paid fedex to put it in a box and have them deliver it both get the results of a melon being delivered 

public transportation and education is another example is it the absolute best no but something is available to everyone 

healthcare the same way we can have a public offering and have a private offering for the better people want"
Conservative,"im well aware that there is a criticism of the left of having a base corporations bad filter that gets applied to everything but dont you think that the right has an equally rigid government bad filter that gets applied in all cases

theres so much nuance to everything the government touches turns to shit including 

 its shit because right wing politicians didnt fund it enough or hamstrung it in order to make it fail to fulfill an ideological point

 as voters we literally can choose the people that run it if we agreed to ignore culture war issues the power to elect competent people is quite literally in our hands and it doesnt depend on the size of your bank account and thats a comforting thought to many there might be an incompetent politician who hired cronies who made it shit because he was elected based on his gun policy thats still more control over the process than many of us feel about crossing our fingers and hoping a corporation does the right thing

 it didnt actually turn to shit but industries that lost out on potential profit want you to think so and they decided that massive propaganda campaigns are worth the investment to try to regain control over the industry"
Conservative,thank you for this reasoned and wellinformed opinion
Conservative,"im generally pretty procapitalism but i think some things are done better with no profit motivation ie public education although i think it could be funded differentlybetter health care public option prisons police fire roads and utilities internet should be considered a utility at this point 

capitalism is great for some things but once it becomes a public necessity it shouldnt necessarily be profit driven obv that starts getting a little slippery when you talk about farming manufacturing and mining etc but thats a whole different conversation"

Conservative,"in what world will you get to know a company additionally corporations have profit margins and shareholders to please corporations are legal fictions that are designed to increase profit for their shareholders and there is case law on that 

if its more profitable for them to treat you they will if its more profitable for them to not treat you and let you waste away they will that is the beginning and the end of getting to know a corporate healthcare system"
Conservative,"i totally get the desire to have transparency and oversight i think this level of increased transparency compared to private companies is a big reason why the government has more red tape and is seen as less efficient in general 

just to clarify are you worried that healthcare wouldnt be an explicit line item in the national budget or are you worried that they would say x amount is being allocated for healthcare but only 80 actually ends up there or asked another way are you more worried about money wasted through inefficiency or money stolen through corruption

if you look at the quarterly financial disclosures that healthcare companies issue youll see that each of the largest ones are all profiting in the billions per quarter not revenue profit that winds up in billions of dollars that americans put into our healthcare system every year that does not go toward healthcare outcomes imo thats a clear sign of a broken system and even if the government doesnt use money as efficiently as a private company might the fact that theres no profit motive in single payer still leaves us better off"
Conservative,would you be okay with introducing universal public healthcare without eliminating private healthcare
Conservative,this is a solution im in congruence with i think healthcare as it is needs a fundamental change
Conservative,"how about we figure out why we have allowed a secretive cartel like healthcare system that doesnt have any pricing for medical services until after the fact and there is no way to get those prices a pharmaceutical system that allows both the makers and middlemen that are in complete conflict of interest pbm and allows them to jack up prices for meds well over a thousand times manufacturing costs

that solution is collective bargaining which is how uhc countries bring down prices and have price transparency they bring massive negotiation power to the table and drop the perversive profit incentive 

the us pays literally doublehttpswwwhealthsystemtrackerorgchartcollectionhealthspendinguscomparecountrieshealth20expenditures20per20capita20us20dollars20ppp20adjusted202022 what our peer countries pay in terms of healthcare per capita more if you account for the fact that many in the us simply do not have healthcare insurance at all or are under insured"
Conservative,in theory government healthcare would solve this medicare is the big example  prices of everything are right there absolutely no mystery i think the idea is that the government would be a major competitor and would create an actual open market ive lived in countries with crappy public healthcare but it set the price for everything right in the open all the private actors had to be transparent because consumers wouldnt buy a service where they didnt know the costs beyond that they had to be competitive because ultimately everyone could just go get that crappy public care and since prices were actually listed on websites providers actually had to compete on costs
Conservative,is a bandaid on a heavy bleed not better than literally doing nothing
Conservative,"but you trust companies who are in the business solely to make money

with uhc there wouldnt be anything for you to choose or worry about when you need care you just go dont have to worry about innetwork or out of network whether your insurance covers it or not etc"
Conservative,would you be okay with introducing universal public healthcare without eliminating private healthcare
Conservative,one idea i heard about awhile back was the possibility of the government competing in healthcare instead of fully tax payer funded they instead use tax dollars to offer extremely competitive rates which in turn will force private insurers to lower their rates from my perspective it also seems like something all sides could get behind
Conservative,a nationalized service doesnt wipe out all private entities in a sector you can mail a letter with ups or fedex if you want
Conservative,this can be effective if you make sure its not just buddies giving the contracts to their buddies i think mixing public and private is going to lead to the best results if there a solution to the above but im not sure what that solution is
Conservative,i believe this is just medicare advantage

why do you think that is in your opinion what is it about the american government in particular that would screw up healthcare that many other countries seem to avoid what do you think they doing differently"
Conservative,"there is currently a shortage of doctors specialists nurses and hospitals

are you implying that people getting less care is a positive because it frees up the capacity of healthcare providers"
Conservative,yes this is the key issue that must be fixed first before we can realistically talk about universal healthcare
Conservative,that waiting list is going to take a year
Conservative,removed
Conservative,yes yes and yes the system is busting at the seams also people should look at their state medicaid system expect it to be like that coverage is terrible 
Conservative,"canadian here id rather us keep a universal health insurance system for moral reasons but find ways to increase its capacity and efficiency 

the main issue is that supply does not meet demand and meeting that demand is what i would call a societal necessity so the logical thing to do would be to increase the ability to meet demand ie more infrastructure and more doctors and nurses 

someonei honestly dont care who at this pointneeds to build a shitton more hospitals walkin clinics and general health care infrastructure there needs to be even more telehealth options than we currently have people should be able to go to medical or nursing school for dirt fucking cheap and it should be as easy as possible for doctors and nurses from other countries to move here hell lets even subsidize the shit out of the leases for gp clinics because those are mostly privately owned and like any business can go under if the rent is too damn high

what is crucial though to me is the universal health insurance the system that pays for it on your behalf that youre entitled to as a citizen or permanent resident just because you exist i think its the right thing to do weve had it for decades were proud of it we even decided in a nationwide poll 20 years ago that the socialist who kickstarted it tommy douglas was the greatest canadian ever"
Conservative,"i cant speak to canada but i did grow up in the uk but have lived in the us for the last decade 

we have waiting lists in the uk but its worth noting that these lists are based on urgency  people wait plenty for care in the us but it usually seems more linked to their resources location insurance plan etc waiting in the us often looks like delaying treatment altogether because its unaffordable 

in universal systems you may wait if your situation isnt that serious because the system is processing more emergent cases faster i think thats preferable to a situation where youre waiting for an insurance preauthorization while wealthy selfpay patients are snatching up appointments despite being less sick

in terms of the government controlling healthcare i think there is significant misunderstanding i have never experienced or encountered a situation in the uk where a medicallynecessary treatment was denied there isnt the same approvals process that exists for most people in the us visavis their insurance company  if your doctor recommends a treatment you will get that treatment without a profit motive and private board of directors and shareholders there just isnt any tangible incentive for a service provider or administrator to act as a death panel  public finances are so large and complex that any savings just arent going to be felt in a way that would be meaningful to operationalize 

at least for the uk people also overestimate how nationalized the system is despite the name of the national health service the bulk of system operations are devolved to regional health boards and the main decisionmakers continue to be local practices trusts and service providers themselves given recent energy around certain types of healthcare in the us like abortion my experience is that governments in the us spend exponentially more time legislating healthcare than governments in the uk where these decisions are very much left to the experts in both the nhs and armslength regulators"
Conservative,"va healthcare has equal or better outcomes when compared to private healthcarehttpswwwnprorg202306141181827077vahospitalshealthcare as confirmed by dozens of papers 

there are some individual hospitals that are bad which is where the clickbait comes from but as a whole the data indicates that the va is better than private care"
Conservative,"its economics in order to keep prices low you need competition and in the case of insurance that competition must be to have no insurance aka pay out of pocket

literally every single first world country with universal healthcare is lower priced and provides better care at the systemic level than the us does every single onehttpswwwhealthsystemtrackerorgchartcollectionhealthspendinguscomparecountrieshealth20expenditures20per20capita20us20dollars20ppp20adjusted202022 the average is less than half what the us pays 

in fact the us pays so much that the taxes we pay for public healthcare programs alonehttpswwwcmsgovdataresearchstatisticstrendsandreportsnationalhealthexpendituredatanhefactsheet7012 per capita is more than what the average peer uhc country pays in for healthcare in total public  private 6651 per capita 

if the us were as efficient at providing healthcare as the average first world country our taxes would actually go down and everyone would be covered"
Conservative,"insurance pools risk when healthy individuals opt out the risk pool is left with higherrisk individuals leading to higher premiums for everyone else as for younger individuals rarely using insurance statistics show that unexpected medical emergencies happen more often than we expect in the us medical bills are the leading cause of bankruptcy and having insurance protects against catastrophic financial loss so while investing 50k might sound appealing one major medical event could wipe that out overnight

all that aside studies indicate that nations with universal healthcare tend to have lower healthcare costs per capita and better health outcomes overall so i think while your perspective is interesting and worth discussing the alternative approach is too"
Conservative,for that to be a proper argument hospitals would have to stop compulsory treatment
Conservative,economics doesnt actually support your argument though for free markets to reduce prices you need healthy competition yes but some industries like healthcare are not free by their nature people will always put their life above money they often dont have time to shop around you may only be able to get the insurance of your employer and the true price of the treatment is usually hidden behind complex breakdowns and insurance all of these reasons and more mean that people dont have all resources to be able to shop around effectively meaning that its not a healthy competitive environment ie it doesnt necessarily bring prices down have you not seen the ridiculous prices for just sticking on a bandaid and shit you call that efficient
Conservative,"1 it is clear to anyone that universal healthcare significantly reduces costs the reason your economic principles dont apply is because the consumer isnt  charged for the service a monopoly is only useful leverage when you can command a price  a universal healthcare system doesnt command a price from consumers it leverages its monopoly to command its price from vendors thus lowering costs 

you want to sell a drug to british patients well all of them are covered by the national health service so we have unparalleled access to a market seeking this medication  well give you x per unit take it or leave it

because of competition in the american system no single system captures enough of the market to be able to negotiate the same types of prices from the very same medical and pharmaceutical manufacturers that sell their products considerably cheaper to universal healthcare systems and because the system is privatized those increased costs are also passed on to consumers in the form of higher premiums higher deductibles higher copays etc 

2 youre literally arguing against the whole concept of taxation and frankly insurance health insurance works the same way  if i dont make a claim i dont get my premiums back those premiums are going to pay for other peoples healthcare the difference is that the care is ridiculously overpriced as a result of the above and theres a cut for all of the unnecessary administrators along the way and of course dont forget about the shareholder dividends that need to be preserved 

i pay school district taxes even though i dont have children i pay for fire services despite never having needed them so far my whole life touch wood i understand that those things benefit our society people being sick negatively impacts our society and id be happy to pay as i do now through insurance for people to be able to get quality healthcare"
Conservative,"ive never waited more than 10 minutes at a post office or dmv

additionally youre already paying for health insurance so the increase in your taxes would be minimal due to the savings youd make on health insurance"
Conservative,"pretty much no one in wealthy countries is paying 4045 instead of 20 tax just to cover health insurance even in scandinavian countries the vast majority of people pay below 40 in tax plus in many countries where they have universal healthcare you have to option to get private insurance instead the fact is in many countries with universal healthcare private insurance is still typically a lot more expensive even in the us medicare costs the government less per person than the average costs of private insurance and yes wait times for nonessential surgeries may be a bit longer in countries with universal healthcare but most people still decide not to go for private insurance instead because it would costs them an extra 100k over their life time 

universal healthcare is pretty costeffective and provides good results if run well and especially with universal healthcare a lot less people would die because they cannot afford health insurance"
Conservative,"how much do you currently pay for health insurance in a year


according to the national library of medicine the cost of uch would be about 500 billion less than what we currently spend on healthcare as a nation"
Conservative,its crazy that you trust the corpos to take care of you maybe they did but its situation specific and may not work out in the end
Conservative,but whats the proposed solution for people in your situation who dont have health care or their healthcare doesnt cover enough of the costs to make it affordable
Conservative,"other countries with close to full public healthcare report higher satisfaction than the us while also spending less in your opinion why do you think that is

Conservative,"what youre arguing for proabably isnt medicare for all

this is more of a nitpick but very few people actually argue for medicare for all medicare is a national insurance program paid for by the federal government as fundamentally a feeforservice system this has problems and inefficiencies but theyre known and at a known scale we can account for with ultimately minor adjustments 

the most popular plans like sanders however are actually arguing for a riskadjusted capitation model with mutual exclusivity with private insurance capitation is a valuebased payment system where all of the risk is on the provider to provide the expected amount of care on that years fixed budget what youll notice about this is that if the government messes up this cost estimate at all you probably dont have a hospital there anymore especially since youve taken away their fallback plan 

on american exceptionalism

american exceptionalism often comes up tacitly in these conversations  other countries did it therefore any of their systems 11 are better than americas and will work here because ultimately america isnt special was the vibe i got when i asked people on the liberal sub to build a universal health system of their dreams the issue is that we are special  were as special as any other country mind you but there are different factors here which make different proposed systems of healthcare better or worse even compared to our current system and yes it can get worse than this  were very highranked in cancer treatment for example but unlike some places we dont prioritize treating stage ivs just because theyre more severe we balance it with stage is and iis who we can get in and out quicker even ignoring that whatever system you implement has to have cultural buyin from the people who use it lest it just get removed so you cant do a cubanstyle beveridge system where medical care is only given at state institutions by state doctors any system copied 11 just wont work functionally"

Conservative,i think many people would be on board with this if health care was affordable we brought my kid in for routine stuff and they pricked his finger for one test that gave us the results in minutes otherwise nothing more than checking his ears and saying yep still good and the preinsurance cost was 800 if we got rid of nonsense like this i think your way would work pretty well
Conservative,so one of your largest reasons for not wanting universal healthcare is because you think people will use it you think we dont have enough hospitals to accommodate paying private health insurance isnt building hospitals or training doctors
Conservative,"it would be very very easy for this to just be a way to funnel money into large cities while leaving people in rural america behind

this is currently already a problem most rural hospitals would not exist without government subsidies if we left it to the free market they would pretty much all shut down as it is not profitable to provide healthcare to rural areas the government is pretty much the only reason they exist at all 

its a simple truth that most doctors do not want to live in rural areas i have a friend whos hospital literally charters a private plane to fly in workers weekly from la to go to work at their rural hospital"
Conservative,"this sounds really good to me but how is that going to bring the current insurance premiums down

right now through healthcaregov my familys monthly payment for our health insurance premium is a small fraction of what the actual monthly premium costs but the government subsidizes the rest most people cannot afford 1200 per month for health insurance and would end up on medicaid which would essentially end up being medicare for all"
Conservative,healthier neighbors and healthier society
Conservative," i didnt say better i said they all have some level of a universal health care im sure they all have their flaws  i agree with what youre saying  this has been a subject ive flipped on softly  i used to be strongly opposed to it but as ive grown and started having a family i shifted to being open and somewhat supporting it

my biggest gripe is insurance insurance is for things that might happen health issues will happen  my daughter fell down the stairs when she was 18 months  she seemed okay and mostly just shocked up but had massive bruises on her her head  we obviously took her to the er because you never know whats going on inside she ended up being okay but dont doubt that we had to weight in our head if its worth taking her to the er for a 3000 bill when it might be nothing  we made the right call and going but you know dang well had concerns about the cost

ideally id like a basic level of healthcare for minor injuries sickness doctors appointments etc then a private option for betterfaster service"
Conservative,"it is generally agreed upon that at systemic level metricshttpswwwkfforghealthpolicy101internationalcomparisonofhealthsystemsentrytableofcontentshowdohealthoutcomesintheuscomparetoothercountries pretty much every universal healthcare uhc country is better than the us at the individual level us healthcare may be better  if you can afford it 

in other words the population gets better care on average in uhc countries whereas individuals who can afford the best of the best care can get better care in the us"

in switzerland you can pick and choose your own healthcare provider and level of coverage that you want meaning that gives me more choice

httpswwwexpaticacomchhealthcarehealthcarebasicsaguidetoswisshealthinsurance693473

note that the system isnt perfect and does have its pros and cons"
Conservative,depends on if the public system can theoretically stand alone if everyone adopted it  current medicare and medicaid pay 80 of what healthcare costs to deliver and perform and if hospitals could have made those payments work they would have
Conservative," the us pays literally double what our peer countries pay in terms of healthcare per capita

how do you arrive or rather the organization you lifted this statistic from at this figure

is that spending a total of insurance premiums billed services andor paid services does this include dental vision plastic or other elective surgery i mean how exactly are they calculating the cost in terms of what we pay per capita 

i ask because i know for a fact that retail prices for healthcare in the us are inflated an xray that might cost 50 actual cost not price may be billed at 500 and the insurance may pay out at 100 if you are uninsured maybe you get a cash discount of 50 because it can not be greater than the insurers discount or maybe the government pays for it at a rate of 150"
Conservative,"and as a result who picks up the difference we do likewise if the government bean counters cant land an agreement on a drug they just dont offer it case in point good luck if you live in britain and have adhd because the nhs doesnt offer concerta ritalin etc 

leaving it to the government will not save the billions that some leftist studies claim it will when has the government ever not blown out the cost of something theres no incentive for them not to"
Conservative,"things cost what they cost what ppp doesnt account for is baumols cost disease  because we have a strong engineering sector where efficiency gains can be had wages go up there meaning wages and thus cost goes up in sectors where there arent many efficiency gains left to be had

if there was a way for healthcare to be delivered in the us for cheaper someone would have done it  many hospital systems are in the red especially with medicare and medicaid paying 80 of what it costs to deliver that care at the scale of some systems being able to cut costs in half would be literal tens of billions of dollars  if we assume theyre all out to maximize profits thats what they should be doing since even if they undercut the competition theyd still be raking in the dough"
Conservative,if you have the government as a competitor then you lose any efficency gains you could make by having them be a single payer instead youre just having more people on an isnruance scheme which routinely pays 20 less than what it costs to deliver care
Conservative,"i didnt advocate for nothing i also didnt provide a solution because i have no fucking clue how to im not a professional  but i definitely dont want federal money thrown at it by the pallet just for the medical complex to eat it up and ask for more like a fat kid eating cake

we need to fix the underlying issue why is healthcare so expensive in the first place these hospitals pharmaceutical companies middlemen like the pbms are all making way too much money for no reason other than they can because nothing is transparent its like they all formed a cartel and are agreeing to hide behind a curtain of secrecy so no forms of competition can arise to bring down costs

its a bit ridiculous when basically every major medical company is making tens of billions in profit annually and still expecting double digit returnsgrowth yoy and still able to pay travel nurses 200k a year doctors 700k and of course the tens of millions in bonuses to executives cant forget the lords of the board room

Conservative,"no i dont trust them either thats why when i dont like what they are doing id just choose another provider

i agree that with uhc there wouldnt be anything to choose buy i disagree with that there wouldnt be anything to worry about so no choices and no voice doesnt seem like a good deal to me

go to rasklatinamerica and let them tell you how good uhc works in their countries im pretty sure thats how its gonna work here thanks but no thanks"
Conservative,removed
Conservative,"not necessarily

your first mistake is thinking universal healthcare is a policy rather than a policy goal  it can be achieved through private insurance with a public option for the desperately poor like in germany with supplemental insurance like in canada or the uk or with health savings accounts like in singapore even in canada where you go will provide more choices  if you go to nonprofits then everything they can do is free but it is highly limited and likely has long wait times if youre not actively dying eg if you have easily treatable stage i cancer you can come back for another prognosis in a couple of years when its stage i for treatment but if you go to a forprofit one in some provinces then you can have the same procedures done for free but have to use private insurance for anything above that which may be objectively better in countries with nationally run healthcare they may refuse to cover objectively the best or even only procedures if they dont deign it worthy and if you dont have the backup option then youre sol so youre still going to have to worry about whether your insurance covers it or not"
Conservative,yes im willing to compromise lets see what the other side has to offer
Conservative,not unless the public system could stand on its own is the private one was removed without making changes to account for that afterwards
Conservative,i agree but many people want that when they talk about uhc i agree minimal service could be provided by the state not the federal government tho
Conservative,many do when people talk about administrative efficiency gains with singlepayer healthcare theyre tacitly saying that the other payers will no longer be an option same when they say an advantage is no longer having innetworkoutofnetwork
Conservative,i have publicly funded internet which is administered by private companies county pays for the infrastructure utility companies maintain it private orgs sell it i live in a really rural area and its better than both comcast and ziply by every metric speed reliability and customer service

this is because in the us we have a literal effective cap on the number of people who can become doctors each year this is due to lobbying from ama 

in other countries training healthcare workers is a national priority so they provide incentives to do so"

Conservative,"what is crucial though to me is the universal health insurance the system that pays for it on your behalf that youre entitled to as a citizen or permanent resident

the problem we have here is we literally have what amounts to almost half of canadas entire population in the us that are not us citizens"
Conservative,"from what i understand it is working better in european countries and why i said i am concerned we will end up with a system similar to canada 

waiting in the us often looks like delaying treatment altogether because its unaffordable

so interestingly this was what happened to my father when he was under va care he was a firefighter for 32 years and shortly after retiring he was 62 when he retired he was diagnosed with melanoma he was too young to be on medicare and opted to go to the va because he was also a veteran he was put on a wait list he was rediagnosed at this and they did do one surgery during this time but no other treatment three years later he was finally able to get on medicare and went to an oncologist immediately they started him on chemo and radiation unfortunately by this time the cancer had metastasized to stage 4 lung cancer he passed away shortly after"
Conservative,id like to add that the uk has private healthcare as well not only do everyone get to use public healthcare people have the option to purchase private healthcare for better quality lower wait times etc

Conservative,literally irrelevant insurance cost in the us are high bc healthcare cost are high doctors make more here than elsewhere lawsuits pay out more here than elsewhere nationalizing it will not magically reduce prices this is exactly why california refused to even vote on a statewide universal healthcare program even with a dem supermajority eager to pass it
Conservative,"literally irrelevant insurance cost in the us are high bc healthcare cost are high doctors make more here than elsewhere lawsuits pay out more here than elsewhere nationalizing it will not magically reduce prices this is exactly why california refused to even vote on a statewide universal healthcare program even with a dem supermajority eager to pass it 

secondly why should healthy people pay for the unhealthy why should the government force them to buy something they dont need or want what authority does the constitution grant the us government  to force free citizens to buy a service why should the needs of the few take priority over the needs of the many isnt that antidemocratic"
Conservative,not necessarily but lets not confuse the angry liberals they are very passionate about forcing  people to buy a service at gunpoint bc of the coercive nature of healthcare ironically
Conservative,"well lets see healthcare used to be inexpensive a few decades ago and now its ridiculous what changed the government got involved im sure you have been so hell bent on nationalizing it that you failed to even attempt to imagine that there are many more ways to encourage competition than shopping around free markets arent that simplistic for example insurance was a free market solution the only government solution is togive them ultimate power over it 

honestly no one asked for your opinion though not sure why you seem to think its ask a liberal with extra steps"
Conservative,"literally irrelevant insurance cost in the us are high bc healthcare cost are high doctors make more here than elsewhere lawsuits pay out more here than elsewhere nationalizing it will not magically reduce prices this is exactly why california refused to even vote on a statewide universal healthcare program even with a dem supermajority eager to pass it 

its not clear it reduces costs in fact since medicare and medicaid have existed insurance prices have skyrocketed and are only comparable to college costs ironically college prices skyrocketed when the government decided to guarantee student loans so no its not clear and i would claim its clearly the opposite 

2 youre literally arguing against the whole concept of taxation and frankly insurance health insurance works the same way  if i dont make a claim i dont get my premiums back those premiums are going to pay for other peoples healthcare

i understand how insurance works however forcing people to buy a service is not constitutional nor ethical i dont care where the premiums go i care that im forced to take a service instead of cash or pay taxes for something i dont want or need i should have the option to buy my own insurance if its such a good deal or take that 20k and use it for whatever i want this is exactly why wages are low wage increases are going straight into higher taxes and benefits why shouldnt a younger person be able to make more income in lieu of healthcare why shouldnt i be able to have a high deductible plan with an hsa why shouldnt i be able to use the money i would be forced to spend on healthcare to pay for college a house an investment or 401k account or simply to pay rent why are you against free choice"

Conservative,"eh rough math of the middle bracket in the uk being 40 on 37k125k gbp and it being estimated that 20 of that is for healthcare so 810 is probably more fair  in general last i ran my own math my effective tax rate would go from 20 to 36 if i lived in the uk for example though thatd include more than just the healthcare difference

to play out the rest of the math 810 of that would be more than i paid via my deduction for my health insurance over the past year and probably right around what my total medical expenses were overall  given what you hear about how the programs are executed in other countries id be hesitant to lose what we have now for something that feels like it could pretty easily be worse plus then also subject to additional changescosts via increased taxes  cynical but i have full confidence that whatever the initial tax hike is going to be to cover it will wind up not being enough in part because throwing money at all these problems still serves to distract from addressing why they cost so much in the first place and then the ensuing argument will be raising taxes even more to cover an inefficient system"
Conservative,which kind of uhc
Conservative,those countries have close to 60 in taxes and very few of those countries are satisfied with their healthcare those that are have very small countries compared to the us and so it is more managable
Conservative,no our citizens are inferior government doesnt exist without elected officials and in turn elected officials dont exist without the voters during my trip to europe i was amazed by how many people seemed to know whats going on geopolitically whereas here few know whats going on i spend about 30 mins a day reading ap news and still dont feel qualified to make judgement calls yet your average voter will vote and not even think about it truly terrifying to me tbh
Conservative,"the us government believes for some absurd reason that it has to infect every aspect of our lives government spending is so high as to be goddamn ridiculous redundant programs pointless programs its absurd if we could maybe cut some of that spending even 510 we could probably institute some kind of medicare for all make rand paul run it and keep it simple enough that even the government couldnt fuck it up

unfortunately we live in a society"
Conservative,"misconceptions on what universal healthcare is

universal healthcare is a policy goal most proponents argue about it like its a policy in and of itself but its not where the debate then needs to lie is in the necessity of having it again i agree and the best system for getting there for us  not just in payer organization and funding but the other sacrifices and systems and bureaucracy and regulations which accompany it and the sacrifices the individual has to make which they often dont raise as necessary and these are fundamentally political discussions with different pros and cons in different amounts depending on to what degree you do all of them  the idea that we need to put aside politics and just focus on good policy is a fundamentally fascist one its literally how fascism argued itself  liberalism and conservatism have failed were a new third way with all of the answers without all of that petty squabbling and this isnt necessarily a negative  fdr was viewed as a fascist in his own time but in the same way mussolini and the nazis were viewed before the war as a getherdone nononsense tyrant who could achieve revival for his country ie positively by the left

ive noticed that the discussion is primarily westerneuropean focused  which of course frames the debate squarely on two of the most expansive state health setups in the first world  while ignoring the most costefficient systems like singapore or japan singapore being a multipayer system of state and private insurance and health savings accounts with minimum dollar amounts and maximum single expenditures with different state and private institutions polymatter did a nice threepart breakdown if youre interested or that may have been on singapore as a whole and japan being a capped partial payer and of course back in western europe you have either private doctors operating out of state facilities in england with no cost to the patient for stateapproved minimal procedures or you have sliding partial payment in france with copays looking to our north and south you have canada and australia being called singlepayer while only providing baseline insurance which covers some things at some facilities 

and of course it ignores the taxation regimes in those countries and the nordics who are supposedly the gold standard both in terms of higher income taxes and vat to fund the government overall and also the pigouvian tax regime to fund bad decisions like drinking and smoking and sugar and fat content plus the other measures americans of all stripes likely find unacceptable  the removal of candy in the checkout line the removal of mascots or any method to market to children from unhealthy foods not just nutrition facts but actual labels quantifying how healthy a product is states which take an interest in running healthcare also have an interest in making it cheap rather than letting it be a place for the voluntarily unhealthy to remove the consequences of their own actions nyc opposed the removal of the largest size of soda cup  imagine what would happen if we told the entire country which are likely less amenable to a universal healthcare regime than nyc that coke was now going to have less than half as much sugar like the uk 

what youll notice about all of those is that nothing actually gets you everything for free  semantic debates about whether its really free if its paid for by increased taxes and there will be higher taxes regardless of the particulars of the system lest it strangle itself you fundamentally will not receive an american standard of care which is higher in many ways compared to many other places entirely at no out of pocket cost to the patient  were much more privacy focused in japan you do your annual battery of tests in a common area while wearing a hospital gown and in singapore a private inpatient room is a luxury were much more focused on cuttingedge read expensive and marginally more effective prescriptions and devices theres an orphan crushing machine article which gets shared around about a 20k wheelchair being denied for a 2yearold and the robotics team made one for cheaper  ignoring that no country would cover that wheelchair for a 2yearold at all as opposed to making lifestyle improvements not that it would help the 2yearold but there are several people who use medical ozempic or viagra for nonintended uses and who used insulin before those were available who would have to make actual lifestyle changes and were much more litigious so theres a lot of extra procedure to follow to limit liability which our staff are more exposed to

or in short proponents often dont understand the level of expenditures in taxes theyll have to have everyone pay and they do come down on everyone in europe rather than just the rich like proponents here may argue if they dont deny having to raise taxes at all they dont understand the level of other oversight and regulation which has to take place more than anyone here is comfortable with they dont understand what level of service theyll get lower and different than what they currently get they dont understand what theyll pay out of pocket almost certainly something even if its less than theyd pay now

tldr  i support universal healthcare i just think a lot of the arguments are often so oversimplified as to be fundamentally wrong or misleading and dont accurately convey to the costs and tradeoffs associated with their proposal if they were even considered at all and as such would be an unmitigated disaster if they were implemented"
Conservative,"because you think people will use it

i listed my reasons not getting baited or guilt tripped

you think we dont have enough hospitals to accommodate

we do not have enough hospitals or staff to handle a large influx the prices are sky high as they are and will only go higher with more demand to handle much more patients those who pay into the system will have to pay for it either though taxes insurance or out of pocket or all three

paying private health insurance isnt building hospitals or training doctors

yes it does it just gets routed through insurance the patient pays for all of the costs that go into healthcare either out of pocket andor through insurance andor taxes all you are suggesting right now is making those costs go up even further to build out more facilities and train more medical personnel its either that or the release valve is that services must drop

thus to summarize again you are not suggesting increasing healthcare services you are only suggesting that those who pay now need to pay more and sacrifice the quality of care they have now"
Conservative,given that only 8 of americans dont have any health care coverage its likely that i dont know anybody in that group
Conservative,"i know you didnt say better i just didnt want to leave that off the table  i would love it if we could find something in between our extraordinarily expensive care and some of the other countries extraordinarily long wait times for certain things

glad your daughter turned out to be ok  you made the right decision i think but i get how every borderline decision has to be weighed against the cost  and some people might suffer by not getting the treatment they need in deciding against the cost in an ambiguous situation"
Conservative,"the assumption that universal care and lower cost go hand in hand is a fallacy we are currently at 93 of the population covered by an insurance plan will the additional 7 coverage cut cost  our cost are high because for most of 40 years we made the decision to chase runaway inflation in healthcare by providing per person funding increase above the national cpi each year 

annual medical inflation tends to be higher than its general cpi counterpart 17 percentage points higher on average than regular inflation the compounding effect over 40 years is dramatic

in europe though the players in the healthcare industry scream increased per person prices above the national inflation are killing them  they are usually told they have to figure it out and manage through it so for 40 years they have done so

in the past when republicans tried to reduce the rate of increase to the cpi rate the opposition was very robust with very emotional appeals that the republicans budget cuts would kill old people and babies 

this worked though there were no cuts just reductions in the per person increases

republicans lost these major battles every time due to far better messaging from democrats driving calls to republicans from crying senior citizens constituents asking their congressman to please dont cut off their medicare somewhere along the line the pussy republicans gave up the fight  no one wants to be known as killers of babies and old people 

private insurance is usually more expensive than medicare but annual increases tend to follow what congress decides

if congress doesnt have the balls to say no to the healthcare providers prices in america will continue to increase faster than cpi

 we made the same mistakes on funding from all sources on college tuition and cost the primary institutions are 100 non profit so its not the private forprofit insurance or providers driving the annual increases above the inflation rate as claimed in healthcare 

it is the 40 year messaging that every american kids needs a shot at a college education and it would be cruel and short sighted for funding sources to not match the per person price increases above cpi needed by the universities once again in europe they just said no to cost increases above cpi"
Conservative,that is what direct primary care would be for for 50 or 75 a month you would have full access to a doctor for those kinds of things and telehealth visits
Conservative,deleted
Conservative,in canada as an example all of your preventative care is completely covered if you have to refer to a specialist you might have to pay a small fee relative and this is where privately purchased health insurance could subsidize emergency visits would also be covered completely
Conservative,"from your link

however inconsistent and imperfect quality metrics make it difficult to compare quality of care in the us and its peers

that kind of sounds like what i said

 thats a complicated subject because there are a lot of metrics you can use and each metric is affected by factors other than whether healthcare is universal or not

or perhaps this one is even closer

life expectancy mortality rates and disease burden can also be influenced by factors that are largely outside of the control of the health system like socioeconomic conditionshttpswwwhealthsystemtrackerorgindicatorhealthwellbeingpovertystatusgini20coefficient20201920or20nearest20year eg income inequality structural racism and differences in healthrelated behaviors eg diet exercise drug use"
Conservative,for me theres always a risk of any big entitywhether its corporate or governmentalbungling something that you rely on for me the reason to mistrust corporate entities more is the fact that theyre profitmotivated and when push comes to shove theyre going to do the thing that makes them the biggest profit if it isnt also the thing that will get you the best care honestly i think we should take the profit motive out of healthcare as much as possible and treat it as a necessity for the community like the fire department or the sewers
Conservative,sorry to reply to you twice but i didnt see this comment before out of curiosity how would you feel about a system where we had universal healthcare for basic needs but then we could get private insurance plans if we wanted expanded coverage
Conservative,"total healthcare expenditure both private and public for each country divided per capita 

as noted this means its an under count for the us since not everyone is covered or covered sufficiently 

more specificallyhttpswwwoecdorgendataindicatorshealthspendinghtml

 health spending measures the final consumption of health care goods and services ie current health expenditure including personal health care curative care rehabilitative care longterm care ancillary services and medical goods and collective services prevention and public health services as well as health administration but excluding spending on investments health care is financed through a mix of financing arrangements including government spending and compulsory health insurance governmentcompulsory as well as voluntary health insurance and private funds such as households outofpocket payments ngos and private corporations voluntary this indicator is presented as a total and by type of financing governmentcompulsory voluntary outofpocket and is measured as a share of gdp as a share of total health spending and in usd per capita using economywide ppps

it is my understanding that this metric does not care about retail prices or cash discounts or any of that stuff"
Conservative,"and as a result who picks up the difference we do likewise if the government bean counters cant land an agreement on a drug they just dont offer it case in point good luck if you live in britain and have adhd because the nhs doesnt offer concerta ritalin etc

britain the worst uhc system imho has a publicprivate system and you can buy additional insurance that covers adhd drugs even with additional private insurance the total cost of healthcare is the uk is less than half what you pay in the us 


leaving it to the government will not save the billions that some leftist studies claim it will when has the government ever not blown out the cost of something theres no incentive for them not to

uh the proof is in the pudding dude

literally every single country in the world has lower cost of healthcare than the us every single one the average cost in high income countries is around 50 less than the us the us is a massive outlier in terms of healthcare costs citation is above 

youre not generally getting better healthcare here either the average person gets worse overall healthcare here than in most of europe"
Conservative,"things cost what they cost

hah nope things cost what the market will bear what the market will bear is based on in part on negotiation power capitalism 101 

 if there was a way for healthcare to be delivered in the us for cheaper someone would have done it

uh huh i notice you brought no numbers lets check out some on our excess spendinghttpswwwcommonwealthfundorgpublicationsissuebriefs2023octhighushealthcarespendingwhereisitallgoing 

admin costs alone are 50 of the difference in the spending between here and uhc countries

cost of drugs another 166 and wages are around 25

uhc significantly reduces admin overhead as there is no profit incentive and you reduce the redundancy from having thousands of insurance systems spread all over  

cost of drugs is directly effected by negotiation power medicare was finally allowed for the first time to negotiate and its bringing prices down the drugs it negotiated an average of 631httpswwwwhitehousegovbriefingroomstatementsreleases20240815factsheetbidenharrisadministrationannouncesnewlowerpricesforfirsttendrugsselectedformedicarepricenegotiationtolowercostsformillionsofamericans

cost of labor is addressed by negotiation power and by making it a national priority to train more 

especially with medicare and medicaid paying 80 of what it costs to deliver that care

yea i heard this but it comes from the literal lobby for hospitals if this were actually true there would be no reason a hospital would continue to take medicare as its voluntary yet the vast majority do it looks like hospitals receive a mixture of tax exemptionhttpswwwahaorgfactsheets20200107factsheetunderpaymentmedicareandmedicaidtexthospital20participation20in20medicare20andparticipate20in20medicare20and20medicaid status and because of the way the underpayment formula works part of the coststocharge formula is fixed costshttpsnashporgwhycomparewhatemployerspaytowhatmedicarepaystextaccording20to20medpacs20march202020costs20while20covering20variable20costs which are not actually effected by actually treating a payment if you treat more patients you get more money to apply to this fixed cost"
Conservative,"its interesting because for example here in washington medicaid and medicare pay better and are much easier to work with than the commercial payors for many services the inefficiency of dealing with commercial insurance is horrendous  so much unnecessary work to prove medical necessity and get constant authorizations 

to give an example i work in addiction treatment the proof is a drugalcohol test and an assessment done by a counselor theres no need to spend hours on additional paperwork nevermind proving that they still need to be in a 28 day inpatient every week 

also this would be a single payer system everyone would have to enroll and pay for it like we do for social security so every american would have the option to just use that the competition would be supplemental insurance and private doctors if you look at the most socialist countries like france they actually utilize a lot of for profit medicine and healthy competition an example is physical therapy their public insurance might cover 10 visits and they have to wait a month to get in to see someone now they have a choice to pay out of pocket or use supplemental insurance to go see a private physical therapist for more sessions or to get in earlier it really depends on what they are willing to spend"
Conservative,yup ok youre definitely not wrong the only point of disagreement i have is that there should be a bridging strategy between the status quo and a better system i think wed disagree that there should be a timelimited like 5 years of medicade for all provided the entire time there is progress being made toward a better system
Conservative,hospitals dont make shit most are operating in the negatives especially with medicare paying so little for their work insurance profits are capped at 3 and theyre required to spend so much on healthcare and only so much on operations pharmaceutical companies definitely charge a lot more than they need to and their marketing budget is higher than their rd budget in some cases but thats only so much of the fat you can trim
Conservative,"no i dont trust them either thats why when i dont like what they are doing id just choose another provider

the problem is that most people cant just choose another provider without finding a different place of employment

while we disagree on uhc for sure i hope we can both agree that tying ones healthcare to ones job is very problematic"

im not here to speak for all liberals im not even a liberal i dont know what any individual means when they say they want uhc until i talk to them more you probably dont either"
Conservative,it can be good dont get me wrong but for ive seen in my country it go wrong covid was especially bad with private companies getting government contracts handling them badly overcharging then finding out they were party donors
Conservative,"problem 1 is that medicare and i believe this includes advantage pays only 20 of the cost of the treatment provided expansion also has to account for people going more often who have unknown and severe conditions due to not having gone before and rising fixed costs to appropriately deal with this new influx but thats a sheer money problem we can solve by throwing more at it

otherwise it really could be expanded with little issue"
Conservative,"i think they were absolutely being honest sadly there are all too many of us in the us who take a hyperindividualistic view to society couple that with cynicism and its easy to come to a position where youre advocating for others receiving less healthcare so you yourself can have access to more

in the spirit of good faith i will note that i dont think most people who come to that outcome are evil people that cynicism i reference though is pervasive across society and is perhaps the most bipartisan thing we have trump himself is a perfect avatar for this fact i dont honestly believe that most republicans like him personally or think hes a decent moral person i also dont think most republicans believe him to have any principles other than enriching himself i do however think most republicans have given up hope on things getting any better so its natural to just say fuck it and go with the wrecking ball who pisses off all the right people similarly its not surprising to see someone support the only conclusion around healthcare they feel might benefit themselves even if the consequences are catastrophic for others and again in the sprit of good faith i dont think the left is above supporting someone like trump we just dont have anyone nearly that charismatic on our side to unify us

if i had to speculate on where i think most on the right land with healthcare it would be pretty much the same as those on the left the system sucks and is doing all of us a disservice its too expensive for the consumer and the working conditions for those in the industry are unacceptably bad i want everyone to get the care they need but me and my family are the most important where i see the right and left finding some distance between them is the promoted solutions to that point the primary disconnect ive found is that the left trusts the government and therefore wants a singlepayer system whereas the right has a deep distrust for the government and is looking for an industry solution in the end though we all still want whats best for everyone if we could find a way to do it"
Conservative,"i think theres some honesty that people are more selective of when theyd use a service based on the cost to them  i dont currently go to the doctor unless im really sick and while part of that is not wanting to deal with the inconvenience theres absolutely the element of cost as a factor too  if it were free to me and i can say this because in the past when i hit my max oop i noticed this change i would be quicker to go get checked out if i wasnt feeling well  one of the major things you do hear about from uhc countries is the wait time and availability and i would have some concern that i wouldnt be able to see someone if i really needed it because of the demand on the system

maybe its less of people getting less care and more people not overwhelming the fixed capacity of doctors  similar to what concerns were during early covid"
Conservative,"not op but doesnt it increase the amount of care needed in the long run 

the best deterrent against many terminal diseases is increased screening and wellness checks

for example its much less expensive to perform regular colonoscopy screens and polyp ablation and removal than treating stage 34 colorectal cancer this requires specialists unique medications hospital stays etc

same is true for most cancers cardiovascular disease diabetes chronic kidney disease etc

it seems that increased initial care would be less time consuming for clinicians because it saves the patient from higher complexity and more costly treatments"
Conservative,"adding on to this  what some dont realize about the training cap is that the government actually funds around 98 of medical residencies federal about 86 and state governments about 12 

we have a healthcare industry generating enormous profits yet the taxpayer is paying to train doctors to the tune of some 16bn a year"
Conservative,i am on the waiting list for a simple upperendoscopy right nowthe first available appointment is 6 months out i live in the us with a good healthcare plan the idea that universal healthcare supposedly has long wait times is not a convincing argument
Conservative,glad you brought that up lets fasttrack most of them to at least permanent residency then
Conservative,yes and if you read the sources youll find that dozens of studies show that it is also equal or better in clinical and surgical health outcomes as well
Conservative," insurance cost in the us are high bc healthcare cost are high doctors make more here than elsewhere 

1 healthcare costs are high here because we lack negotiation power to bring down prices for services and drugs prices on services in other countries are vastly lower than they are here in large part because of negotiation power 

2 doctors salaries are high due to the fact that we have fewer doctors than most other countries 26  1000 vs 36  1000 across the oecd which includes lower income countries this is because the us has a literal cap on the number of people who can become doctors each year lobbied by doctors whereas other countries make it a national priority to incentivize the training of healthcare workers 

this is exactly why california refused to even vote on a statewide universal healthcare program even with a dem supermajority eager to pass it

yes california alone lacks the massive negotiation power to make things better this is something that needs to occur at the national level alongside reforms on healthcare worker training every other nation on earth recognizes healthcare is a national priority so they incentivize training

nationalizing it will not magically reduce prices

indeed other reforms are needed but we pay literally double what our peers do there is alot of fat to cut and most of it would be achieved by higher negotiation leverage

do we really think we have nothing to learn from countries that achieve more with far less especially when theres like 50 of them"
Conservative,"irrelevant ookkk 

healthcare costs are high due to administrative expenses  up to 25 of healthcare spending  and inefficiencies in the us system not just doctor salaries or lawsuits the us spends nearly twice as much per capita on healthcare as other developed nations only to rank lower in health outcomes twice as much 

as for why healthy people pay its how insurance works everyone pays in so no one is financially ruined by medical bills also uninsured americans cost the system a cool 42 billion annually which you and i absorb through higher premiums assuming youre insured 

but yea irrelevant"
Conservative,you completely ignored everything i said when youre seriously ill i can tell you havent been because everyone is pro the us health system until they get ill youll realise that for a market to be free is requires the customers to be able to effectively choose the product they buy with health insurance that is not the case for the reasons i stated if you can explain to me why its a free market then i may buy your idea that the competition is reducing costs until then maybe read up on free markets and what is required for a market to be free
Conservative,are you in a red or blue state
Conservative,"western and northern europe on average pay 4050 income tax i dont know what youre talking about buddy

thats just not true look up germany for example httpsallaboutberlincomtoolstaxcalculatorhttpsallaboutberlincomtoolstaxcalculator

so at 100000 euros it says you pay 24745 euros in income tax thats 247 63 or 6300 euros goes to health insurance 11 to unemployment insurance and 84 to public pension thats 41 you pay on 100k euros income but that includes health insurance and pension contributions which in the us you would pay for on top of taxes

or look up norway httpsnotalentcomentaxcalculatorsalary1080000fromyearregionnorwayhttpsnotalentcomentaxcalculatorsalary1080000fromyearregionnorway

1080000 nok seems to be around 100000 on that income in norway you pay 338 in tax and that already includes health insurance i believe

in new york you are paying just over 30 on 100000 income and that does not include health insurance or pension contributions taxes in europe are not as high as you are implying"
Conservative,"in the uk you would actually be paying less in in taxes and other contributions overall than you would in many us states you can check out this tax calculator httpswwwtheaccountancycoukcalculatorssalarycalculatorhttpswwwtheaccountancycoukcalculatorssalarycalculator

l is the most common tax code i believe based on 76500 gbp which is 100000 a year you would have a net pay of 53612 gbp which is pretty much 70 of your gross pay around 235 is income tax and 63 goes to national insurance but your employer also pays a bit over 12 of national insurance so thats 42 in total however that covers healthcare via the nhs but it also entitles you to a basic state pension

in new york for example you would be paying around 30 in total based on 100000 income federal and state tax and fica tax then health insurance is easily another 10000 so thats an additional 10 pension contributions for a very basic pension plan that would be roughly equal to what youre paying for in the uk via national insurance contributions would at least cost 5000 a year so another 5 so far were at 45 but your employer also has to contribute 765 to fica so that is in total now 5265 you would be paying in new york compared to 42 in the uk

so in new york youd be paying around 10 more overall in taxes and other contributions other states have lower tax rates than ny but still compared to the uk youd be paying more not less in most states"

Conservative,"if people could get healthcare regularly there wouldnt be an influx because it would be a steady stream additionally the costs would go down because you would take the entire insurance industry out of the picture in addition to the fact that if people could get regular care they wouldnt have to wait until something becomes catastrophic to go to the er its much easier and cheaper to treat something early than catching it late 

the reason he restated your reasons was to point out the flaws in your logic its not baiting you its askjng you to back up your assertions which if they are your genuine thoughts you should be able to do but if they are thought provided to you by the news or your angry uncle well then you cant"
Conservative,i have health insurance but rarely can afford to actually use it when needed  its still primarily for catastrophic use cases   12kyear with a 7k deductible
Conservative,"its funny that wait times used to be the big argument but due to a variety of factors here our wait times are horrendous i had to wait months for a follow up mammogram to see if i had breast cancer  i guess its good that i didnt my mother needed a pcp and the local major medical group wouldnt even put her on a wait list she had to call every day and got in after almost two months 

i know one major cause is that we limited the amount of doctors we could have for a long time and even with a course correction we are way too behind so not something that universal healthcare would fix

i do know that most of the countries ive lived theres always an option for private care thats faster and better in china of all places i was finally able to get dental care after having my teeth fall apart for years in new york because none of my jobs ever offered dental insurance i opted for the most opulent dentist that still cost 1025 of what they cost here they had incredible technology there and things like warm heavy blankets and asking for my music preferences and beautiful clinics my coworker went to the public dentist which he described as something out of a horror movie but he was such a penny pincher that he was still thrilled it only cost him like 3 for the visit 

i visited a european country recently i was waiting months to see a specialist so i just made a same day appointment at a private clinic there cost me 50 and the doctor was lovely and told me to take my time to chat about my problems when i finally got in to see my doctor here the tests they ran had the same results so the quality seemed similar from speaking with family if id waited for the public option in that country it would have been a similar time frame but included in my taxes whereas here i hadnt met my deductible yet so it was a couple hundred dollars on top of my premiums"
Conservative,actuallyrose put this more eloquently below but just to pile on id need to see evidence on how much longer their wait times are i have sat in the er for 10 hours before
Conservative,is that something you are suggesting should exist or it already does because right now i know i pay literally 1000 out of my paycheck monthly for insurance then i still have to pay 6075 per doctor visits  its insane
Conservative,it ended up being closer to 2600 because we hadnt hit our deductible
Conservative,"however inconsistent and imperfect quality metrics make it difficult to compare quality of care in the us and its peers

this is because the us doesnt track those metrics in a systemic wayor at all whereas most other oecd countries do if you go look at the oecd data youll find that the us drops off completely on some metrics because we just dontcant track it 

thats a failure of the highly fractured us system 

life expectancy mortality rates and disease burden can also be influenced by factors that are largely outside of the control of the health system like socioeconomic conditions eg income inequality structural racism and differences in healthrelated behaviors eg diet exercise drug use

indeed when you have large complicated systems there are imperfect metrics on those systems that doesnt change the fact that in those imperfect measures we are often times at the bottom and not by a small factor either you cant possibly say that life expectancy and mortality and disease burden isnt majorly effected by healthcare 

further you ignored the other factors that are primarily effected by our healthcare system such as access and cost where the us is at by far the bottom or the fact that people in the us simply skip care because they cant afford it 

we also have fewer doctors per capita and fewer hospital beds per capita and higher wait times for primary care which in turn effects specialist care wait times"
Conservative,removed
Conservative," honestly i think we should take the profit motive out of healthcare as much as possible

what would be the point of going to college for that much time then

to quote dr cox

why did i get into this for the same four reasons everyone else does chicks money power and chicks

sure there are lots out there that become a doctor to do good and help people but lets face it making good money because of it is a reason too

healthcare is a commodity a service provided by a third party its not a right and no matter how much you may need bread another commodity you dont have the right to rob me to pay for it"
Conservative,id be fine with that as long as i have oversight
Conservative,"it is my understanding that this metric does not care about retail prices or cash discounts or any of that stuff

this metric may not care but it actually does matter when trying to facilitate any decent conversation about healthcare because if affects those expenditures

for instance if someone buys a cpap machine the insurance may bill the insurance company 300 and bill a customer 900 for the total price of 1200 which is an inflated retail price because of how convoluted our pricing and delivery is some peoples insurance may cover 100 some peoples insurance may cover 30either way the manufacturer and retailer inflate the retail price so as to provide steep discounts to insurers and then may collected inflated prices due to the obscurity of the market

im not disagreeing with you im merely pointing out that comparing our healthcare costs to other nations is not an apples to apples comparison because of how opaque and messy it all is"
Conservative,people in canada who need urgent care or surgery are often on a waitlist stretching months or at least a year down the road they tend to end up across the border to an american hospital where they can get it done much sooner rather than wait
Conservative,"britain the worst uhc system imho has a publicprivate system and you can buy additional insurance that covers adhd drugs

and in doing so you lose any efficency gains from a singlepayer system things cost what they cost here so you need a way to reduce costs not prices

literally every single country in the world has lower cost of healthcare than the us every single one the average cost in high income countries is around 50 less than the us the us is a massive outlier in terms of healthcare costs citation is above 

now adjust that by paying their whole economy us salaries youll find a lot of the difference shrinks away

even without accounting for that insurance pays roughly 8700 per patient while medicare pays 6k per patient after you adjust the risk and level of care which you shouldnt do for gross expenditures but for comparing efficiency is fine we already run a very thin operation because again if someone could have cut a cost they would have by now"
Conservative,"the clinic i went to when i lived in washington just cut off all of their medicare and medicaid patients because they were losing tons of money on them private insurance on average pays 143 of the cost of providing care while medicare and medicaid average 80 with 67 of hospitals accepting them at a loss which is completely fine as long as you have a good balance less than 23 medicare or medicaid since most hospitals in the us are nonprofit already so theyre not after massive profits but you also cant be constantly hemorrhaging money or else you cant continue operation 

also this would be a single payer system everyone would have to enroll and pay for it like we do for social security so every american would have the option to just use that the competition would be supplemental insurance and private doctors

aside from that definitionally not being singlepayer its in the name single payer most of the time there isnt an equal vertical the two sets are competing in  state insurance is generally given an edge either by artificially creating their own network through accepting it being exclusive with accepting private payment or by artificially denying the ability for private insurance to cover certain things and the issue with that is that if the government doesnt get its compensation to providers correct which they objectively have not since the programs started then before too long you just dont have hospitals or clinics in that area

or you can skip making accepting different payments exclusive of each other but then we just have expanded medicare which still underpays but now for more people who are using it instead of private insurance and we dont get the administrative efficiency gains of only dealing with one insurance company the state

and you can tell this is how most us proponents of universal healthcare conceive of it   a true singlepayer system monopsony you can tell this because their perception is that they will be able to get any necessary care so not with limits like in every country which actually has universal healthcare at any location implying that medicare will be the only option so all providers will have to take it and all providers will save massively on administration costs of only dealing with one company again implying its the only option which im fine with conceptually we just have to be realistic and conservative on just how much total spending we can reduce after making all the necessary adjustments for it to not fall apart

even worse is something like sanders plan which relies on capitation as its payment mechanism the idea that you can just give a facility a lump sum of money at the start of the year and that will cover all of their operations well its a payment system which puts maximum risk on the provider and exclusivity of those payments with private insurance means theres no fallback plan if things go wrong such as not paying enough or if theres a disaster they cant apply for aid in time for 

if you look at the most socialist countries like france they actually utilize a lot of for profit medicine and healthy competition

france is also not singlepayer private insurance aside theres copays 20 for a gp and 25 for a specialist last i checked theres filling fees and they cover only a portion of the cost based on a sliding scale of severity  cancers for example get fully covered while everything else gets covered progressively less compared to that and its that added friction which makes the system run smoothly at all most us proponents view universal healthcare as everything is completely free all the time  i do not because im realistic and would gladly adapt frances payment system to here provided we switch from feeforservice to a valuebased care model like the health care home one"
Conservative,yeah i agree on that one job tied healthcare is stupid af companies may offer a healthcare provider as part of their benefits but employees shouldnt be obligated to stick with it if they dont want it

Conservative,"many national healthcare systems remove explicitly or effectively the private option

im not here to speak for all liberals im not even a liberal i dont know what any individual means when they say they want uhc until i talk to them more you probably dont either

because this debate is so confused with people thinking of universal healthcare as a policy and using it interchangeably with national healthcare and socialized medicine and singlepayer you have to look at the way they describe the costs and benefits to figure out what they mean and for the most part they are describing a true singlepayer insurance system rather than a fake one like canada or australia while also trying to mitigate the drawbacks by saying it is actually neither of those"
Conservative,yeah and i get thats its easier to bury the grift at a national level compared to a small county local level i understand the problem but i also think medical care should not be a for profit venture and i think nearly everything should be a for profit venture except infrastructure defense certain types of r and d education  and healthcare

Conservative,this is what i learned recently as well  tax payers need to pay people in residency a salary while they are there and so if we want to increase the number of folks in residency wed need to allocate more tax money  i didnt hear  of medical schools as being a bottleneck
Conservative,this has more to do with the type of coverage you and have where you live and what type of provider ive had to schedule my dermatologist appointments a year out because this doctor is so popular at the office that i go to if wait times werent so bad for universal healthcare then why do so many in countries that have said healthcare seek care in the united states mainly for the reason of not wanting to wait months on end

prove it"
Conservative,"again the us is not given the constitutional power to implement a national healthcare plan period the states might be able to do so individually this eliminates any opportunity to negotiate prices even if that were to be successful which is questionable we are are a free market country you know what else can attain negotiation power the free market via people choosing to not have insurance or to choose lower cost options these two important options have all but but been banned so its no wonder prices have skyrocketed california did not avoid anything bc of a lack of negotiating power they didnt allow a vote bc it would have resulted in 30 state income tax plus federal tax rates and everyone paying taxes and virtually all businesses would have relocated please feel free to try to explain the benefits of national healthcare to those paying 60 in taxes 

secondly i was asked my opinion so i dont really care about yours feel free to post why you want universal healthcare in ask a liberal but here no one cares bc its ask a conservative"

Conservative,"i was keeping it federalfederal since state can vary but yes the addition of state would change things though my health insurance contribution was only about 6k definitely not 10k  i was also keeping it to my direct contributions not sure why wed count employer contributions as part of my tax rate  
  
went back and looked that calculator wasnt working for me  missed the standard deduction for the uk so that takes it from a federal effective tax rate of 20 us up to 32 uk not 36  my overall including state il would take me to 30 so it is more comparable  that said that 2 for me and this could obviously be different for other people translates into roughly what my average medical expenses would be

that means that my tradeoff is the incremental cost of a major medical incident which is mitigated by my oop max vs what you hear are the issues with experiencing uhc my understanding is mostly influenced by colleagues in canadaengland that have both shared frustrations with an inability to receive care when it can be considered elective and the general risk of then having the tax rate continue to go up as costs i believe will inevitably exceed what the tax inflows would cover

all that said your point of many states already paying more than the uk is interesting because surely adding uhc into the programs here is going to cause an even greater tax rate in the us so wed just be magnifying that problem"
Conservative,i agree we need better infrastructure for education im also not convinced we have discovered the best way forward seems like dumping money and hiring 10 vice principals while teachers are still paying for their own supplies is failing our kids

we can debate it from there thats fine  but we have to drop the language about your view being generally agreed upon and approach it as a fresh conversation without the logical fallacy of bandwagoning

other countries are more cost effective"

Conservative,"im not against doctors and nurses being paid well even in countries with universal health care doctors tend to make decent money and most gps in canada own their own practices as a business its just that the money for most of what they do comes through the public insurer and private insurers do still exist for supplemental things like dentistry prescriptions and physiotherapy 

its really no different than doctors in the states getting paid through medicare its just that in canada every citizen and permanent resident is entitled to be on medicare"
Conservative,this is a straight apples to apples comparison healthcare is simply much more expensive in the us
Conservative,"im american and regularly have to schedule doctors visits three to five months out needed to see a gynecologist in january because i was having periods every two weeks instead of four and she was booked out through april i lucked out and there was a cancelation but if there hadnt been id have either had to see a doctor i didnt know and trust for very invasive and private examinations if i could find one that wasnt also booked for months and theres usually a reason no one wants to go to them or wait for four months wondering what was wrong 

i dont know if youre aware of what a transvaginal ultrasound entails but i dont want it done by a rando ive had too many bad experiences with awful gynecologists id have waited and dealt with the anxiety if i had to 

been waiting since july for an october 30th dentist appointment too our healthcare system does not always provide speedy care"
Conservative,"wait times are a problem no question but statistically canada is still better than the us in getting treatment to the people people in the us just die because they cantdont get healthcare at allhttpswwwhealthsystemtrackerorgindicatorqualitymortalityamenablehealthcare we are worst in the first world in amenable mortality that is people who die from treatable things because they dont get treatment at all for those people wait times are infinity 

for the record because you specify urgent care wait times in canada are dependent on urgency and if you have an urgent need in canada youll be seen much faster this is born out in the data where cardiovascular and oncology surgery has a wait time of 1725 weekshttpsiimgurcomvsuopi6png when you see those crazy stories of 20 week wait times its because theyre including elective and nonurgent surgeries 

yes canada is still slower than the us but overall people actually get treatment and as a result are healthier and dont simply just die like people in the us

also for the record canada is the worst country in terms of wait times pretty much every other country is significantly better"
Conservative,"and in doing so you lose any efficency gains from a singlepayer system 

so you admit that a single payer system is more efficient cool 

and no you dont because the private insurance in the uk also benefits from the negotiations done by the public system proof is in the pudding the numbers cited are for both public and private system together 

things cost what they cost here so you need a way to reduce costs not prices

lol there is clearly plenty of margin to cut on services 

and you reduce costs further by making it a national priority to train more healthcare workers like every other nation on earth did you know we have a literal cap on the number of people that can become doctors in the us its why we have fewer doctors per capita than most of the first world 

now adjust that by paying their whole economy us salaries youll find a lot of the difference shrinks away

higher wages account for only 25httpswwwcommonwealthfundorgpublicationsissuebriefs2023octhighushealthcarespendingwhereisitallgoing of the difference in per capita healthcare spending so while its a factor it is in no way driving the difference thats mostly price of services and drugs administration cost and profit all of which is directly addressed by negotiation power 

high healthcare wages can be addressed like every country addresses it by making it a national priority to train more healthcare workers per capita and incentivizing it 

we on the other hand have one of the lowest doctors per capita in the first world effectively by law due to doctors lobbying to restrict training to keep wages high 

we already run a very thin operation because again if someone could have cut a cost they would have by now

uh huh sure we do thats totally why every other country on earth can achieve services for 1215 the price and no its not just the cost of labor per earlier citation 75 of per capita cost difference is directly attributable to things that uhc providers can address with negotiation or removal of perverse profit incentive"
Conservative,"its not sad

sad is subjective check my flair is it really surprising to you that this is my opinion i for one am not at all surprised that you disagree"
Conservative,fyi the us ranks among the bottom in terms of doctors per capita pretty much every first world uhc country has more this is because they incentivize training doctors over there whereas we have a literal cap on the number of people who can become doctors each year due to lobbying from doctors
Conservative,"wouldnt it be better to solve the actual problems though i could be wrong but my understanding of your argument is that we have a bad system with too few doctors currently and increased access would make it even harder to see a doctor the actual problem being that we have too few doctors due to stupidly capping the number of doctors 

in this case call me the most right freemarket libertarian in that i think anyone can be a doctor who can pass the qualifications to be one why in the world are we artificially tampering with the market on this"
Conservative,"having grown up in a country with universal healthcare and having lived in the us for the last 10 years i agree with you that a given individual typically can find faster care in the us

however healthcare needs arent always typical what ive observed is that many people in the us in urgent need of care have to wait longer than they would in another country while betterresourced americans who dont really need care can access services the very next day

this causes significant inefficiency doctors are happy to take your money for a sameweek appointment for diagnostics you dont need for a condition that doesnt exist but it means someone else continues to get sicker while undiagnosed making their condition more and more serious and more and more expensive when if they finally are treated 

youre happy to pay more for the convenience of accessing nonurgent treatment urgently and that contributes to the rising cost of urgent treatment that was treated nonurgently"
Conservative,doubt it i live in one of the top 10 most populous cities in the us there should be plenty of doctors here i even asked if there was any sooner appointments in the next big city near me

these two important options have all but but been banned so its no wonder prices have skyrocketed

Conservative,just dont reply if you dont want a discussion man
Conservative,"fair enough but again that also includes health insurance and i tried to look it up and from what i understand it also includes pension contributions in the us those things are not included in income tax so if we deduct healthcare and pension contributions you pay more like 25 tax on 100k income in norway and on top of that keep in mind that many europeans and scandinavians have access to free university free childcare and monthly child benefits and in many european countries the state will also pay for several months of maternity leave

so effectively actual income taxes arent that high in europe compared to the us and europeans are getting a lot more for the money they are paying to the government in the us much of the taxes people pay go to the millitary industrial complex or corporate welfare"

the reason he restated your reasons was to point out the flaws in your logic

there are no flaws i will be targeted to pay for the rationed healthcare of all of the people you want to have free healthcare nothing is free and you simply want me funding other people to take away my healthcare

Conservative,uh other systems have fixed it and shown by having more doctors than we do
Conservative,"i mean conservative politicians have just as much power to remove the cap on doctors and find ways to increase the amount of doctors theyve had control of government and democrats would happily vote for such a bill 

this is actually my biggest issue with the current republican party  they find it much easier to not do work to fix our system either and they just say look how bad democrats are i dont understand how people support thatwhy dont republicans hold their own politicians accountable

in terms of the mta both democrats and republicans have caused the issues httpsenwikipediaorgwiki2017e280932021newyorkcitytransitcrisis

hasnt bankrupted any other country i agree it would bankrupt a single state as we do notcan not operate like a country does we have freedom of movement within the us and no universal healthcare reciprocity like europe 

this is exactly why wages are so low we get our wage increases in benefits instead of cash

um uhc would decouple healthcare from employment allowing you greater freedom of choice of jobs as you no longer need to take into account benefits this increases total comp transparency and would encourage more movement of people from job to job 

hell just eliminating medicaidmedicare and all other social safety nets would allow us to pay for a 1200 monthly ubi that would do far more good than healthcare

possibly i wouldnt be opposed to dropping all social safety nets in favor of ubi but healthcare is one of those things that you can not negotiate fairly on an individual basis this is because it is often done under treat of death for that individual it needs to be done before hand at the group level the bigger the group the more negotiation leverage"
Conservative,still replying lol you clearly do want a discussion but youve realised youre wrong and need an excuse to back out
Conservative,"well i can see your ideas are clearly informed from rigorous evidence based study your intellectual prowess is unimpeachable 

totes"
Conservative," either way i am not trying to convince you of anything i was just discussing with someone else what i would like to see


for sure i appreciate the sources"
Conservative,deleted
Conservative,"thats because you seemed to think it was ok for the us to absorb them which is easy to say if you are not a us citizen 

why do you think the us has the infrastructure its true from what ive heard the canadian housing market is in bad shape but we are not exactly sitting pretty here in the us"
Conservative,"healthcare and education is infrastructure they power productivity in our society 

you dont get to negotiate extra powers via the constitution thats not how it works the government does not get the benefit of the doubt it is presumed guilty 

 am trying to understand your position i choose to do so by presenting data outside your viewpoint and seeing your response yknow asking a conservative 

thats not at all what youre doing you can ask by typing in a post 

hasnt bankrupted any other country i agree it would bankrupt a single state as we do notcan not operate like a country does we have freedom of movement within the us and no universal healthcare reciprocity like europe 

states are no different than countries really same economics apply you make things non profitable or taxes too high and people and businesses leave this is exactly why europe is struggling

um uhc would decouple healthcare from employment allowing you greater freedom of choice of jobs as you no longer need to take into account benefits this increases total comp transparency and would encourage more movement of people from job to job 

and it would raise taxes thus lowering wages you know what else would decouple healthcare from jobs the government not forcing or subsidizing companies to offer it and instead letting people choose what to do with the extra 20k a year im a union rep and this is the 1 reason cost of living raises are so low all the extra money goes to benefit increases 

possibly i wouldnt be opposed to dropping all social safety nets in favor of ubi but healthcare is one of those things that you can not negotiate fairly on an individual basis this is because it is often done under treat of death for that individual it needs to be done before hand at the group level the bigger the group the more negotiation leverage

you can you just cant remove the customer and expect it to be negotiated you could eliminate insurance entirely by paying a membership fee to your local hospital just bc you dont understand how alternative systems work doesnt mean you cant negotiate not having insurance is still the ultimate negotiating tool and insurances only real competition which is why obamas fee for not having insurance was so hated"
Conservative,so 6 replies to my original comment from people other than the op assuming i am somehow uniformed or havent heard the exact same liberal  argument that dem politicians say incessantly that argument isnt convincing and imo is deeply illogical anti constitutional and frankly laughably repetitive repeating it to me isnt going to do anything except irritating me which i think is the actual point so that the mods remove any counterpoint to your religion so sir this is like a wendys america and so either order a square burger or go to another establishment who serves what you are looking for
Conservative,"i agree that any workable plan will need to expand our healthcare base just as every other nation has by making it a national priority to incentivize the training of new healthcare workers i googled around the text of the medicare for all plans and it does recognize the need to expand and train new doctors and the need to promote adequate access to equipment the bills recognize this and itll be up to the administration agencies to come up with specifics in a long term phased roll in as as analogy you dont have congress make laws on the specifics of how drugs are tested they dont have anywhere close to the expertise you create the fda and hire a bunch of phd level experts to study the problem and who then come up with the specifics 

in any case your claim that the plans dont address these concerns is false they do 

so i ask you do you recognize that uhc has proven to be generally better and cheaper in every other first world nation on earth if yes than why shouldnt we attempt it here if no then why not"
Conservative,i think the us should do what they can to accommodate them i didnt say it would be easy you would need to ramp things up as well but yall have handled huge influxes of immigrants in the past and people arent going to stop wanting to move there so you might as well get over yourselves and make it a welcoming place i want the same for canada thats why i think we should build more affordable homes starting yesterday and why we shouldnt rely on the market to do it because capitalist market economies rely on exploiting scarcity and scarcity is not what we need right now
Conservative,"you dont get to negotiate extra powers via the constitution thats not how it works the government does not get the benefit of the doubt it is presumed guilty

so you still havent provided anything that negates the powers granted by the general welfare clause and the interstate commerce clause we regulate all sorts of things based on those clauses 

thats not at all what youre doing you can ask by typing in a post

yes it is i am seeing how some conservatives feel as well as providing information to see how they react to it i can also inform at the same time as well 

and it would raise taxes thus lowering wages 

actually if we were as efficient as the average high income peer country we would actually lower our taxes we pay so much for healthcare that the taxes we already pay for public healthcare alone are more than the average peer country pays in total 

the government not forcing or subsidizing companies to offer it and instead letting people choose what to do with the extra 20k a year

uh huh then why were we the highest ppp adjusted per capita cost since as far back as there is data 

  im a union rep and this is the 1 reason cost of living raises are so low all the extra money goes to benefit increases

cause theyre expensive and getting more expensive every year whereas every country with uhc pays half what we pay 

you can

no you cant no one can negotiate fairly when unconscious or dying or generally under duress 

 you just cant remove the customer and expect it to be negotiated

the customer becomes the collective bargaining group youre a union rep you know exactly how this works 

 you could eliminate insurance entirely by paying a membership fee to your local hospital 

hrm sure sounds like collective bargaining to me 

just bc you dont understand how alternative systems work doesnt mean you cant negotiate 

yep negotiation by collective bargaining or collective action 

 not having insurance is still the ultimate negotiating tool and insurances only real competition which is why obamas fee for not having insurance was so hated

paying a membership fee to your local hospital is quite literally the equivalent to insurance its paying for services through the pooling of cost and risk i would say that its just on a more local level with less negotiation leverage and less robustness to the system"
Conservative,deleted
Conservative,lmao yes we should just get over ourselves and let anyone in the world thats wants to come here free rein until all of our social services collapse must be nice to live life outside of the chaos so you can freely criticize anyone not 100 onboard with the collapse of their country
Conservative,"so you still havent provided anything that negates the powers granted by the general welfare clause and the interstate commerce clause we regulate all sorts of things based on those clauses 

and i disagree wholeheartedly with that happening i think thats the greatest failure of the judicial system in us history short of only slavery 

again i dont really care what you think i dont want universal healthcare and im a taxpayer and voter ive explained my reasons and i dont care to hear your opinion on it im not going to argue with you about my opinion 

paying a membership fee to your local hospital is quite literally the equivalent to insurance its pooling cost and risk

yes but that is fully optional and youre suggesting forced compliance at gunpoint for our own good  see the big difference there now go away"
Conservative,mmm yes what a nonanswer that ignores everything i said im sure youre a very serious person
Conservative,"well the us is the wealthiest and thirdlargest country in the world its just kind of narcissistic to not want to expand your ability to accommodate a growing population i dont want either of our countries to collapse any more than you do so we should both increase our ability to meet the needs of a growing population thats just the logical thing to do 

do we want to be the national equivalent of an unhappy person who deliberately acts unpleasant and selfish to push people away because theyre afraid of being hurt or do we want to be helpful and kind to the best of our ability i know which one is better to be as an individual"
Conservative,"again i dont really care what you think i dont want universal healthcare and im a taxpayer and voter ive explained my reasons and i dont care to hear your opinion on it im not going to argue with you about my opinion



ok but your supposition that the constitution disallows this isnt born out by the reality of the legal landscape which even you admit 

yes but that is fully optional and youre suggesting forced compliance at gunpoint for our own good see the big difference there 

yes i see effectiveness being the big difference one method has proof of large scale effectiveness across many countries to the tune of a 50 drop in cost  

the other simply doesnt 

now go away

k see ya"
Conservative,"the wealth of the us is a paper tiger we are 35 trillion in debt weve made it up until now because the petro dollar has reigned supreme but that is going away we did not renew our agreement with the saudis under biden and brics is making a move to unseat us as the global economic power 

i have no problem with immigration but it cannot be unlimited and unchecked like it is now no country no matter how rich they are can sustain this we are not able to even keep up with the people in need we have much less import millions at a time its just reality and the cracks are rapidly showing 

for what its worth im not unhappy at all and choose to live in a world of reality instead of ideological fantasy"
Conservative,"i wasnt implying you yourself were miserable im just saying neither of our countries should act like an antisocial person on the macro level 

but anyway i think the true wealth of both our countries lies in our capacity to do work with people and our physical resources money after all is only an abstraction of those things 

both our countries need to undertake massive public works projects not just on the federal level but also stateprovincial and local and grassroots i think we can agree that totally topdown sovietstyle planning wont work longterm and will just be disastrous if government creates and spends money in such a way that will allow more economic activity to occur down the line that otherwise wouldntwhich i think it would if it gives people jobs and just generally makes it easier to live in the us or canada no matter who you arethen i think wed be on the right track 

furthermore the kinds of folks i often see saying lock the gates protect our resources tend to not also be the kind of people who want to be more generous to the people already living here theyre often very against policies meant to alleviate or reduce poverty domestically for citizens so thats another reason for me to think even more immigration control wont solve anything"
Liberal,i think american progressives are overly obsessed with the british nhs and assume american universal healthcare has to look like that id much prefer the us take a more hybrid version of universal healthcare similar to whats seen in germany or singapore
Liberal,"lets first clarify that universal healthcare is different than single payer healthcare 

single payer is good when you have a small homogenous population with similar lifestyle and healthcare needs it would never work in the us were too big too diverse and have a dizzying array of different health needs canada has tried a variation of it by handing responsibility to each provinceterritory and allowing private hospitals to operate by billing the government in most provinces the system has effectively collapsed with some people going their entire lives without a family doctor 

universal is good when its actually universal the us has moved toward universal care technically it already has it insurance through your employer medicaid if youre unemployed or disabled chip for children tricare for veterans medicare for the aged and the aca to fill in the gaps for everyone else with subsidized plans the issue is that delivery is unequal and depending on where you live and who you get your plan through it can often be unaffordable its not forced upon anyone so people who dont think they need it are often the ones who get screwed 

we need to expand the aca to provide basic healthcare to everyone  this can be done through expanding medicaid to the remaining states setting caps on prescription drug prices and medical services raising the income limit for medicaid access and coordinating benefits with private insurers this doesnt mean everyone deserves the latest and greatest technology or biologic  it just means that everyone should get baseline adequate care with private insurance delivering the rest

this is how obamacare was supposed to be with a public option it could have been so much better we were one vote away 60 needed and democrat joe lieberman removed it from the final bill one vote several states have introduced a public option since i live in wa and our public option is very affordable and provides great healthcare but unfortunately its not universal we can get there but we need cooperation from a bipartisan congress to get it done 

tldr universal coverage should be delivered in a coordinated easy to understand publicprivate multipayer fashion with increased regulationcost caps to provide baseline coverage to every american with existing private options to fill in the gaps it can be done"
Liberal,the legal basis i am familiar with specify that everything medically neccessary is covered this does leave some grey areas to be resulved on a case by cases basis for example the line between medical nad cosmetic dental treatment blurs that tends to be interpreted strictly reconstructive cosmetic surgery is covered vanity surgery is not etc
Liberal,"i would expect it to cover everything youve listed

having lived in places that do it makes for a much better and much healthier society"
Liberal,"everyone is completely covered for any issues related to healthcare and mental well being a healthy society is better equipped to contribute to humanity in a meaningful way 


it is mathematically emotionally and logically the most efficient way to improve the world around us"
Liberal,yes to all but my limit may be in high cost end of life treatments and cosmetics
Liberal,"ive had my own plan thats based off of singapores uhc system

government insurance plan would be as follows

 ambulance service
 physical injuries care
 vaccinations
 pregnancy care
 prescribed medications
 necessary longterm care
 maternity care
 mental healthcare
 necessary homecare services
 any other doctormandated medical care

all household will be required to pay 10 of their income into a household healthcare fund which shall be the primary source of healthcare expenditures for households

households will receive government assistance for medical bills based on a sliding income scale with households within the top 20 of earners paying the full bill themselves unless the payment plan exceeds 10 of household income 

all households will be ensured to not pay any more than 10 of their netincome on healthcare expenditures"
Liberal,"id approach it in the same way that a hospital emergency department applies triage  what resources are available and who is in the most need  do we spend money on ivf while we neglect care to pediatric intensive care units  do we spend money on viagra when men are dying of prostate cancer     
in short id put more of the decisions in the hands of doctors and ethicists"
Liberal,"ivffertility treatments i would probably cover these because i think it would be politically popular to do so making the system more likely to be implementedmore robust afterwards but were that not the case i probably wouldnt because i think it would reduce the number of children being adopted and thats a net negative in my mind

dental care would cover an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure and bad teeth lead to poor diets which lead to a lot of more expensive health conditions

optical im assuming this means just like eye examsglassescontacts and not more significant eye related medical issues  this is relatively cheap so i could go either way on it to be honest

lasik if were coving optical i would cover lasik as well since if im not mistaken it probably saves money over the long term

over the counter medication i would not cover this  im going to talk about this a bit later but i would administer the system through pcps and anything they determined was necessary  anything people could get on their own would be outside the system

first aid supplies ditto above

glp1s for obesity im assuming this means like ozempic  i dont really know enough to say and im not sure if anyone else does either  its my understanding that people are mostly doing this for cosmetic reasons at the moment and we dont know if these drugs are also addressing the negative health side effects associated with obesity or just the superficial ones  if its the former i would say yes assuming the relevant professional board determined it passes a costbenefit analysis if its the later i would say no cosmetic procedures should be a private responsibility not a public one except in extreme cases

therapycounseling im a bit on the fence here as well  if we had infinite resources to do so i probably would but excluding situations where people have significant mental illness it would be one of the last things i would prioritize

home health nursing care i would cover this if it were cheaper than putting people in nursing homes but not if it was more expensive

long term acute care this is something i would leave up to a medical board to determine  i understand we dont have infinite resources and i would want them to be used where they would do the most good

cost sharing so the way i imagine the system working in my ideal world is that any time you have an ailment you pay a small nominal fee to see a pcp and a higher fee for emergency care  anything the pcp prescribes is covered at no cost to the patient unless the patient could have gotten it on their own  the pcp compensation is set up in a way that they dont benefit from overprescribing unneeded care possibly in a way that discourages them from doing so if we can fine tune it such that it doesnt lead to worse care for the patients  im not particularly worried about people making going to the doctor a fun free time activity but i do think that a lot of minor medical issues will go away on their own so its worth encouraging people to wait it out a little bit and see if that happens  i dont think its a good idea for people to not follow through on professional medical advice though so i dont think there should be any const barriers after a diagnosis  the nominal fee would reoccur each new visit"
Liberal,"the average cost per person for insurance premiums is around 500mo with many people paying near or over 1000 usually withheld from paycheck or negotiated out of direct pay if not paid separately

this takes into account only the people who actually buy and pay for health insurance imagine how much lower that number would be if it came out of every taxpayer instead its not like the service is going to get any worse than the ruthless profitdriven corporatization model right now one that is subsidized by some americans but not all"
Liberal,"it seems like japan has one of the most comprehensive coverages under their universal healthcare system while being one of the cheapest healthcare spending per capita   
httpswwwthelancetcomjournalslancetarticlepiis0140673620307509fulltexthttpswwwthelancetcomjournalslancetarticlepiis0140673620307509fulltext

they cover

 hospital visits
 primary and specialty care
 mental health care
 approved prescription drugs
 home care services provided by medical institutions
 hospice care
 physical therapy
 most dental care

i would include hearing evaluation and hearing aids as well eye tests and prescription glasses"
Liberal,why is this downvoted giving off vibes of bad faith its a question i mull over myself a lot and figured would be pretty appropriate for this forum
Liberal,my preference would be a public option mixed with a minimum standard set for basic insurance regarding what is covered with basic plans being nonprofit see switzerland i think doctors should decide what is covered based off the standard of care not government and its fleeting whims
Liberal,"on your list the only things i wouldnt cover directly as part of uhc would be first aid supplies otc medication lasik and fancy glasses but i would make those part of an hsa style plan 

the rest of these things either allow people to function in society which improves income tax receipts improves the prospects for population growth or prevents long term expenses as a matter of fact i would go a step further and make 1 year of parental or elder care leave part of this"
Liberal,"all the way

simple facts the us is now crossing the threshold of spending 13k per capita on healthcare while the other high income nations with universal healthcare are clustered between 4k to 5k

we can literally cover everything and save a fucking shit ton of money thats how broken things are now"
Liberal,"ivffertility treatments

yes

dental care

functional not aesthetic

optical

exams and basic glasses anything more than those 80s nerd glasses and youre going private but well leave the prescription with you

lasik

if its cheaper than multiple of the above its not covered under normal insurance so nobodys expecting it yet

over the counter meds like tylenol coughcold meds

not delivered otc

first aid supplies

no

glp1s for obesity

if theyre working for the patient honestly i dont want to pay on a per med or per procedure basis at all but instead for a visit managing obesity the doctor gets a fixed cost they can allocate

therapycounseling

for actual diagnosible mental illness

home health nursing care

only when it is cheaper than a nursing home or care facility

long term acute care

kinda have to"
Liberal,"worth noting that obsession goes back to the nixon administration and is the reason we didnt get a universal healthcare system put in place back then ted kennedy killed it because he thought hed get an nhs style system under the next president

why we want a system under performs the rest of the systems and is easy for conservatives to undermine and fuck with is beyond me"
Liberal,"right it seems like most progressives believe universal healthcare  single payer which just isnt true

i personally would like the us to have a uhc system like singapores they spend less of their gdp on healthcare httpswwwtheglobaleconomycomsingaporehealthspendingaspercentofgdp compared to any eu country and the usa while having a similar higher gdp per capitahttpswwwtheglobaleconomycomsingaporegdppercapitacurrentdollars than the usahttpswwwtheglobaleconomycomusagdppercapitacurrentdollars of course another major reason for this is because they live a far healthier life than other people in the world but still 5 of gdp for world class healthcare is astonishing

eta having people contribute to their own savings account for healthcare will make them be very mindful of healthcare consumption since theyre not conditioned into thinking that since its being paid for via taxes they can use it for anything they want without concern of the pressure it puts on the system as a whole and i think itd work well with the more do it yourself culture we have in the usa and if you truly need aid if you truly cannot afford proper care even with your healthcare fund account then youd get government assistance"
Liberal,why
Liberal,"single payer is generally associated with the beveridge type healthcare systems it is used in a range of nation with a wide range of population hetrogeneity such as the uk italy the nordics iberians etc  no issues of relevant size has ever been noted relation to population diversity

canadas system is what is known as national insurance it is used in canada taiwan and i think japan 

every system is different even if built over the same model canadas system is known for being very slow compared to other systems the uks system has been underfunded by policitcans for decades and is having a crisis due to that but in the process has become known for being very resource efficient and good with the more common ailments even as issues that are expensive to treat and apply to fewer people have been deprioritized"
Liberal,"i am very much pro universal healthcare and very much in agreement with you in spirit but i disagree on some technicalities

it would never work in the us were too big too diverse and have a dizzying array of different health needs

i do not buy this argument canada fits closer to a model of someone who should have it working but does not there are diverse countries with greater populations than canada able to make single payer work france uk brazil south africa maybe ukraine canada is pretty tiny  given its land size the particularities of canadas system faltering is mostly a domestic issue rather than particularities of making single payer work given demographics and brazil has a population of 220 million and is incredibly diverse more so than usa

the reason i point this out is because paradoxically usa has unwittingly created a protosingle payer system through medicare that services all 50 states and it currently hoards the most expensive strata of population proving its resiliency and effectiveness compare to decentralized private plans this is why so many on the left are proponents of medicareforall

he us has moved toward universal care technically it already has it

it most definitely has not us care is more like a swiss cheese with too many holes and despite all these programs its not even close to filling it for example i did not qualify for medicaid because i moved in with my parents after a family tragedy a mother in the family got medicaid for her children through chip but herself was not eligible despite making minimum wage full time in a state with medicaid expansion or how about concepts like open enrollment exist meaning de facto america will never have universal care because there will always be a period when you can fall out 

with existing private options to fill in the gaps it can be done

something to keep in mind afaik every european state has some combination of privatepublic even the most hardcore one sided single payer systems sweden uk etc have private options usually via work like usa to fill gaps it does not need to be that public gets barebones private fills the rest it can be public delivers everything private speeds it up"
Liberal,romneycare in mass is similar to what you have in wash but the public option masshealth is offered on a sliding scale from 0 essentially medicaid to a reasonable fee based on income  free riders no healthcare plan are essentially fined via the state income tax system
Liberal," single payer is good when you have a small homogenous population with similar lifestyle and healthcare needs it would never work in the us were too big too diverse and have a dizzying array of different health needs

  
this is a political problem not a functional one  its harder to build and maintain support for such a system in a diverse society than in a homogeneous one because opponents can always pit groups within the former against each other"
Liberal,hey thanks yea i agree re medically necessary was just interested in digging into that blurry line a little more right now sometimes glp1 agonists arent covered for obesity even though obesity is a risk factor for so many other medical problems seems short sighted to me then ivf for example  its again generally out of pocket though often medically necessary for some folks to have kids
Liberal,yea end of life stuff is tricky any thoughts on how to manage that probably a combo of guidelines and then medical team discretion for specific instances can get messy for sure but im not sure there is a better way will be some tough convos when medical teams convert patients to pallliative from restorative care against family and patient wishes
Liberal,makes a lot of sense not too far off the aca option we have with subsidies and a cap on out of pocket
Liberal,agree with this in general but its kind of a zero sum approach when wed also need to decide how big to make the healthcare pot in general id love a world where all of the above is covered but i dont really have a gauge on if thats practically possible at this level of economic productivity overall wondering how to even approach answering that
Liberal,"appreciate the details im with you on almost all of it 

i go back and forth on the nominal fee aspect you suggest just from personal experience when i had care 100 covered i pursued an mri that was very low yield in that the results really wouldnt change management of my issue but the doc offered and i accepted just to know where i stood better with my injury with 0 copays i consumed way more healthcare than i do now with 15 copays and my outcomes are really no different but it wouldnt be that way for everyone and even 5 copays are going to deter a lot of folks from needed care hard to balance efficiency and high yield care with maintaining access 

re otc meds yea thats almost how it works now i prescribe tons of tylenol just so its free for folks who need it but most things that tylenol can treat dont even need a doctor to lay eyes on run of the mill aches and pains end up paying out of pocket even though that suffering is real though we dont want to clog up the system by having ppl take provider"
Liberal,"i see your point and am tempted to agree for a few years there we had the mandate under aca  was the resulting revenue available for healthcare spending any higher then 

my impression is that a lot of the currently uninsured would not end up paying much in premiums given economic status most uninsured folks i see at the hospital that end up getting enrolled in emergency medical are low ses and wouldnt be paying 5001k in healthcare taxes per month as they dont even make that much in income"
Liberal,"wheres the savings we can make it definitely isnt on the clinical side  expenditures need to expand quite heavily to continue at the same level of service but for everyone because wed need more facilities and staffing due to the barrier to access being rightfully lowered especially if that expenditure is the sole payer in which case theres an automatic 25 increase so medical procedures dont bankrupt a hospital when performed

we have a hard floor of 160 what the nhs spends due to baumols cost disease making salaries all around 60 higher"
Liberal,"its apples to oranges 

americas population is way sicker than most of europe we are way more litigious which drives excessive and costly medical testing to decrease liability and finally the culture is way different vis a vis shared decision making and offering treatments  many interventions we do here would not even be offered in many health systems in europe

thats not to argue against covering all of the above just to say we wont magically be able to do so at europes price point unless a lot of things change along with universal coverage"
Liberal," is easy for conservatives to undermine and fuck with is beyond me

what makes a system easy for conservatives to fuck with is if wealthy and middle class people arent effected by them doing so  the benefit of single payer and nhs type systems is that they are"
Liberal,"why we want a system under performs the rest of the systems and is easy for conservatives to undermine and fuck with is beyond me

because private anything bad"
Liberal," it does not need to be that public gets barebones private fills the rest it can be public delivers everything private speeds it up

this 100  the public system should be good enough that most people are fine with it by itself  a private system should basically just be for people who want luxury care of some kind or filling in gaps that are super niche"
Liberal,yes obamacare was modeled after romneycare if every state set up its system like mass we would be so much better off i really respect states like ma ca wa co mn and ny for setting up systems to cover as many people as possiblesome have achieved nearuniversal coverage
Liberal,"single payer is rare in the world and among countries with universal insurance i saw a person from denmark explain how they had national mandates for minimum care levels but multiple 5 districts that manage the healthcare and pay the bills in their area so they are accountable to local concerns 

denmark has a population less than metro atlanta but regionalize their management and payments

us healthcare cost now 18 or more of gdp with a many highly paid workers i wonder what even a gradual downsizing to a more reasonable 1012 would look like thats a multi trillion dollar a year cut

i unfortunately think it would mirror the shrinking of america union manufacturing base from 19751995 american healthcare just doesnt cost more it also pays more than other nations and its not just to the doctors that doesnt mean such cost reduction shouldnt happen but it will be very painful"
Liberal,we treat it in the same way we fund the military
Liberal,yeah i have seen arguments against nominal fees and i dont think someone is unreasonable for disagreeing with me there but i ultimately think the benefits would outweigh the downsides  i mean i would make preventative stuff like a yearly checkup and vaccines free but if we limited it to like 1 hour of the national minimum wage i think it would do a lot more to dissuade false alarms than real issues mostly because there are far more of the former than the latter
Liberal,"just look at this httpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofcountriesbytotalhealthexpenditurepercapitamediafilelifeexpectancyvshealthcarespendingjpg

i am ducking over people saying its some sort of american exceptionalism we cant have sane healthcare costs

you are the problem you right there

just get the fuck out of our way and well fix this"
Liberal,medicare already operates more efficiently than private insurance this is just fud
Liberal,yeah if its just that then we need to find a way to get these people under control we should have had universal healthcare 70 years ago and their rhetoric is going to delay it another 70 years
Liberal,"  5 districts that manage the healthcare and pay the bills in their area so they are accountable to local concerns

my wife had nearly that many companies to choose from via a single employer and each was offering 24 different plans  moving from that many plans to 5metro area would still be a massive reduction in administrative costs

  
that being said there is no healthcare system that doesnt involve trade offs its just a question of what balance of sacrifices you prefer higher expenses longer waits serving fewer people or providing fewer services"
Liberal,"where are the savings to be made and how do current proposals make them without sacrificing quality or speed they all seem to push prices arbitrarily down using a capitation system without accounting for the influx of new patients with an unknown health status which requires more investment not less looking for bill numbers and projections here

because yes our care is expensive likely too expensive but there are just as many ways the government can intervene which make things worse as they would better"
Liberal,hospitals take losses on medicare patients
Liberal,"what happens when you dont have an open mind i wish more progressives at least online idk if most are like this irl would accept that you dont need the government to full fund and provide healthcare in order to have high quality affordable healthcare i mean hell you arguably dont even need the federal government to handle healthcare at all though that obviously would make at least single payer a nonstarter and has a host of problems that would most likely prevent it from realistically happening

i personally prefer singapores system of uhc ive already made a replyhttpswwwredditcomraskaliberalssbf9s4s4zeshowing why i support it

edit looks like some people arent too happy about what you have to say lol"
Liberal,this is it i lived in canada bceverything was free at pointofcare but i had to wait 3 years for a family doctor some people wait decades i moved back to the us because for me i value care that i can actually accesseven if i have to pay
Liberal,"estimates are were burning about 25 on administrative costs alone translate that as paper pushers between insurance and providers spending weeks haggling over something that should be a known quantity

in a world where the markup on medications is blatantly insane youre acting like theres no way to reduce costs

ive worked on remote only software teams for two decades now i have coworkers in basically every corner of the world

not a single one of them would trade their healthcare for the us system not a single one

im so sick of the apologetics over this bullshit"
Liberal,i just want to point out that it doesnt matter if the money is being spent at the point of care or not as much as if its being spent at all  canadas wait times arent because its free at the point of care its because theyre spending half as much as we are or whatever the percent currently is  if they doubled what they were spending they could have a lot more doctors and wait times wouldnt be as long
AskReddit,"im canadian and let me tell you that i have never once had to put off getting care because i couldnt afford it 

 i come from a working class family if we had to pay for out healthcare my parents would never see doctors or go to the hospital even with my dads congenital heart issues it would be too expensive for them socialized medicine saves lives and most of us dont mind paying a few extra dollars in taxes for that safety net"
AskReddit,"yeah 

people claim that we wait hours in the waitingroom but as a canadian this isnt true we get admitted extremely quick"
AskReddit,yes  it will result in better healthcare that is also overall cheaper
AskReddit,if every other major first world country can do it i feel like the us can too
AskReddit,"the us should have universal healthcare for one simple reason

because youre the richest country in the world who blows trillions on bullshit wars if you can afford to bomb poor men and boys hiding in caves you can afford to take better care of your own people

thats it thats the only argument you need for it"
AskReddit,yes but with concerns  first no matter what the government tells it will cost triple that number and youll get closer  when was the last time the government was right on the cost of anything  two based on poor cost estimations whatever the tax is that will cover it wont be enough  that means higher taxes andor lowering the minimum income level before being taxed  and three there will such intense lobbying by pharmaceutical and others in the health care industry the end result will not even be close to what was originally championed
AskReddit,"yes just from a financial perspective it makes more sense most people currently pay about 20 of their pay checks toward insurance premiums on top of copays and deductibles 

universal healthcare would require about 4 of your pay check instead and would cut out the deductibles 
costs would also go down over time because more preventative healthcare would reduce instances of costly severe healthcare needs 

fewer people would die yes there would be wait time but at least people would see a doctor as it is now quite a few avoid the doctor unless its an emergency and many people died from preventable issues 

ive seen people die from very treatable early stage cancer because the treatment would bankrupt them even with insurance so they choose to let it run its coarse diabetics who die from lack of meds people who die of sepsis because they were too poor to afford the copays for a doctor visit to get antibiotics the list goes on 

imagine how beneficial it would be to suddenly have easy access to preventative care or the sudden influx of money because youre not sending 20 of your check to an insurance company"
AskReddit,yeah we should itll let more people live we wont have to bankrupt someone over a broken limb or worse cancer treatment
AskReddit,"i dont know anymore you guys 

do you want to continue to be the only country that doesnt have what we all have its so incredibly strange"
AskReddit,literally dies laughing in european
AskReddit,"yes 

 all other developed countries and even some under developed countries have it

 people have to stay at toxic jobs for good benefits instead of being able to switch to another job with less benefits

 mandatory medicine like insulin and just mandatory medical procedures is just immoral to make people pay for"
AskReddit,health care should be a human right not a luxury
AskReddit,"as a brit the idea of paying for health care is just bizarre 


my daughter was born 15 weeks early she weighed 1lb 10 oz 752 g she was in intensive care for months neonatal  care for longer on oxygen for 18 months had heart and eye operations blood transfusions ventilators the fucking lot cost 0

shes fine now 8 years old but that was as you can imagine a pretty stressful time if money had been a factor too i dont know how wed have coped or if shed have got the same care"
AskReddit,if people cannot afford to call an ambulance because to do so would plunge you into bottomless debt what does that say about how your system treats its citizens the value of a society can be witnessed by witnessing how that society treats the weakest of its members those weakest what are they but those who are sick poor or imprisoned
AskReddit,yes there is no logical argument against this human right
AskReddit,there is absolutely no justified reason for not having universal health care
AskReddit,yes our system is so broken now with much higher costs and lower life expectancy higher infant mortality etc its crazy to tie it to employment especially as weve seen now where illnessneed for medical care directly coincides with high rates of unemployment and loss of health insurance coverage streamlining to a single payer system would cut so much bureaucracy from medical billing and money could go to care instead of profits and overhead also as more jobs become part time gig jobs etc it means people can have coverage as can people who decide to become entrepreneurs while many bitch about the taxes that would increase its basically the same as we currently pay in health insurance premiums
AskReddit,yes its the moral and ethical thing to do and it would be cheaper for the government
AskReddit,"if we did i could finally get the surgery every doctor has insisted i needed to save my own life for 20 years now so far i keep putting it off because i dont have that kind of money and the tumor keeps growing 

got big enough last year i experienced torsion on my left ovary you cant imagine the pain its like giving birth while passing a kidney stone at the same time but no one will help me because im poor and dont have medical insurance 

so i learned to live with the pain i would kill for universal health insurance and im not kidding"
AskReddit,"the us should have universal healthcare but it should not be adopted strictly from another country it should instead take the best aspects and apply them accordingly 

canadas system for example is great for coverage but bad for prescription drugs 

i would look into the swiss and dutch models as more fitting for us to borrow ideas from"
AskReddit,no for a number of reasons the most simple being i dont trust the government to run it
AskReddit,im english but we also have universal healthcare and it saved my life when i caught bacterial pneumonia a few years ago so i say yes
AskReddit,this should only be allowed to be answered by canadians who have left canada and live in the us
AskReddit,yes next question
AskReddit,"probably but with the caveat i would like private insurance to still exist and i would want us to get serious about restricting illegal immigration 

i dont want to spend more money for less care and then have to wait in line behind 50 hondurans with the sniffles that got here last week"
AskReddit,"yes

why for every reason

why not for no reason"
AskReddit,removed
AskReddit,yes sure it works great in canada and is cheaper for not only the people but also for the economy of the country
AskReddit,the us should but also at the same time ramp up regulations on food have heavier fines for speeding nd drunk driving probably invest more in actually making the country healthier because the moment uncle sam is responsible for americans crappy life style the moment there would be a serious effort to change it
AskReddit,i like the idea but i dont trust the government to allocate the additional tax funds correctly
AskReddit,no  there too many americans in this world
AskReddit,yes anything else is crime against humanity profiting off someone elses pain
AskReddit,absolutely we are one of the few countries that dont and tried to require you to have it and charge you for not having it
AskReddit,yes healthcare should be a right not an expensive privilege i didnt have insurance for years and thus couldnt get the care i needed for a thyroid problem due to not being able to afford it as a result of years of neglect to my thyroid problem it developed into a disease that i now have to live with for the rest of my life the insurance options that i had at that time were hundreds per month which i clearly couldnt afford yet i was fined greatly due to not having insurance the us profits way too much from anything medical and it shows where priorities are
AskReddit,canada should just absorb us
AskReddit,um yes
AskReddit,"yes perhaps it would not be as good as the current quality of healthcare but there are two problems with that

first few people actually get to use the top tier medical care that foreign millionaires fly here for if you go to the hospital they will simply say that the procedure you need is not covered

second if you go into the emergency room after a year of suffering because an affordable procedure was not covered by your health plan the emergency visit will only stabilize you not fix the core problem 

you will be billed an outrageous amount and you will still be sick

the va is famous for taking a long time to get veterans any treatment for a fast growing cancer if the patient dies they save money right

people with a great healthcare plan will be worse off people with a crappy health plan will see no change and people with no healthcare will be better off

you know who wont be hurt millionaires there will always be highpriced upscale clinics for the rich staffed by the best doctors"
AskReddit,"yes

us population has the highest obesity rate in the world"
AskReddit,i believe medicare could be expanded to include preventative care  bloodwork vaccines generic prescription anything that could be done at an urgent care and milestone cancer screenings  people in the us are irresponsible and i dont think we should be paying for a life long smokers chemo or mr 600 lb lifes gastric bypass  private insurance could still exist to cover other incidents and lifestyle choices  theoretically private insurance should get less expensive and a less comprehensive universal healthcare wouldnt bankrupt an already heavily in debt us economy
AskReddit,no goverments role is to make sure other people dont violate your rights the rest is up to people themselves
AskReddit,removed
AskReddit,"healthcare in the us is used to force people to stay at their jobs or can prevent career growth in other ways

ive turned down job offers because the insurance was so poor or because i would have to give up insurance and work as a contract or temptoperm for god knows how long

forcing people to obtain healthcare through employers means people can spend a needlessly long amount of time putting off treatment or seeking help i got laid off in april of 2020 and finally got health insurance just last week i was a week away from getting a cpap but because cobra is a fucking scam and no one else was willing to hire direct i had to hold off on getting it all the while struggling with severe fatigue headaches and migraines

health insurance can still lead to exorbitant costs despite now having access to health care i have to find a way to shit 600 before insurance will take over the rest of the cost of the cpap keep in mind 600 is what i pay to cover what student loans wont access codes and text books every 8 weeks 

health insurance burdens people professionally and financially and puts people under unnecessary hardship and i tell my partner in a civilized world my mother wouldnt have had to rely on my sister to care for her or get her to dialysis and i wouldnt have had to wait a year for a cpap"
AskReddit,"should probably 

could probably not"
AskReddit,"medical bills are absurd my back went out where i couldnt stand up straight or walk without help i couldnt get into a chiropractor for 4 days so i went to the er hoping for help because i was on the verge of tears

doctor refused to xray my back but opted for giving me a shot to ease the pain he checked back after 30 minutes to ask if it felt better i told him no they told me my blood pressure was high and i was free to go

that left me a 2000 bill for absolute garbage thankfully i got into a chiropractor who did an xray right away to find a pretty glaring issue 23 visits a week over the next few months helped greatly but fuck that lousy hospital and their bill

i guess itd be nicer to not have to pay for lousy medical care if its not your lucky day so yeah i think it should be universal"
AskReddit,after chipping out 10k for trival medical expenses of the last five years i can honestly say yes
AskReddit,"im all for universal healthcare but if it happened now it would be a nightmare 

i think the bit that we dont talk about enough is the shortage of doctors we already have in the us 

id love to see the government and philanthropists invest in expanding medical school capabilities and lets make it super cheap to get a medical degree at least relatively speaking 

at that point the arguments against universal healthcare wont have near enough traction"
AskReddit,"yes there is absolutely no reason not to

 except profit motives of the commodified healthcare system we already have but thats pioritizing profit motives of people that already have enough profit over people that will literally suffer or even die because of our broken system"
AskReddit,"yes i dont know why universal healthcare is such a debate in the us everyone should have the right to afford to stay alive its just basic human decency 

you will probably pay more in taxes but you wouldnt have to pay hundreds on health insurance and massive medical bills

im from britain and im so glad we have universal healthcare i can always get help if i need it the nhs does have issues but during the pandemic we realised how important the nhs is i know for sure my fridnds and family would be dead or in massive piles of debt if we didnt have universal healthcare also my taxes help me and someone else and their taxes help themselves and me its a kinder system"
AskReddit,it should be a right the biggest problem is the amount of power insurance companies and big pharma have over our policies right now it would cost 4 trillion dollars to fund universal healthcare for reference thats the current total us budget that was almost 1 trillion over everyone would have to be taxed double or the elite taxed at the same rate as the working class again another group that has too much power in our policies but one thing to keep in mind is how much is doubling your taxes vs your medical bills per year and not current medical bills but bills not racked up because you couldnt afford it
AskReddit,yes because it makes the paperwork and figuring out insurance premiums easier
AskReddit,"i pay a fortune for incredibly bad coverage  i pay 1500 a month and it doesnt cover a thing  it gets more expensive every year and the coverage gets worse  

bring on the universal care"
AskReddit,although it works in other countries it wouldnt work in the us they have many issues and one issue with canada is that you can sometimes end up waiting a while to get advance or specialized care considering the fact that 70 of american adults are over weight it should be everyone elses issue to pay for their consequences if tom smokes everyday for 30 years its not my responsibility to pay for it is the us health care system broken yes but making it public makes it worse their is a reason why the us has the longest 5 year cancer survival rate most of the tech that universal healthcare countries use is from the us   reversed engineered or takes 40 years to make newest french artificial heart
AskReddit,"i agree with socialized medicine but there are probably better countries to model after than canada

im extremely grateful for the healthcare we have id be dead without it but it could use quite a bit of work biggest being our wait times are astronomical 

we have next to no vision or dental and our mental health and addictions programs need a lot of work we do very little for maintainence work and will only touch a problem when it starts debilitating your life my legs are maligned causing improper wear on my hips knees and ankles but because its not causing me debilitating pain they wont even look at them our rural populations have poor options for healthcare and often require long travel for proper care our long term care homes are overfull causing our hospitals to take the overflow leaving less room for real patients we also have little for prescription coverage

socialized healthcare  good canadas healthcare okay"
AskReddit," im canadian and let me tell you that i have never once had to put off getting care because i couldnt afford it

neither have i though 

although id argue that with the consistently longer wait times canadians face compared to americans you are putting off getting care for financial reasons"
AskReddit,the wait times are also a bad argument anyway id rather wait than not be able to afford to have the procedure done at all critical people are also still taken first
AskReddit,people here also complain that it takes a long time to get a regular doctors appointment i just tried to get in to see my doctor and the earliest appointment is april ffs seven weeks just to see my doctor to get a referral and wait 48 more weeks to get an appointment with a specialist and it will probably cost 350 for the two appointments not including any tests they want to run thats two to three weeks worth of groceries for us two people and a dog just because im getting crippling headaches that keep me from working
AskReddit,"only argument against it but thats soshulism


i dont get why some people are so opposed to the idea of having their tax dollars help someone else not suffer crippling debt for the rest of their lives but theyre totally fine with the us government pissing it at billionaires and arbitrary wars in the middle east and shit like that


every other developed country has healthcare but the richest country on the planet and the one that repeatedly advertises itself as the greatest country in the world just says screw you silly peasants and lets people get charged 2000 for an ambulance ride"
AskReddit,yeah we pay way more money for worse health outcomes the life expectancy of an american is 35 years less than a canadian
AskReddit,"yep perversely it will also increase the standards of private care private healthcare here in the uk is very competitive as its competing with the nhs  which is free

its a winwin for literally everyone both rich and poor except the insurance companies you already spend a similar  of government spending as we do on healthcare yet we have universal healthcare  youre being robbed blind"
AskReddit,i agree it took us years to pay off my husbands surgery for his broken wrist  which was someone elses intentional fault who wasnt found liable it is ridiculous how expensive everything is here
AskReddit,then why no to move to another country
AskReddit,im canadian and have never had a problem with prescription drugs nor has anyone i know
AskReddit,"the us cant even run medicare right

i know an 83 year old lady who pays 600month for diabetes medication even with medicare"
AskReddit,i feel like i shouldnt be surprised i had to scroll this far down to see this answer totally agree our government would not be able to make it work even with bipartisan support id love to keep my working quality healthcare that costs a ton rather than have shitty care for no cost
AskReddit,not sure how it works in canada but here in denmark without a social security number one will not receive treatment
AskReddit,treating illegals homeless and unhealthy people are already baked into the cost of health care the only difference is right now its paid in our insurance to private companies vs additional tax dollars to the government
AskReddit,the uk has a national healthcare system and still has private insurance so i dont think thats unusual
AskReddit,"  i would want us to get serious about restricting illegal immigration

even according to wholly fabricated numbers from rightwing sites like fair healthcare for illegal immigrants covered by taxpayers accounts for only 07httpswwwfairusorgissuepublicationsresourcesfiscalburdenillegalimmigrationunitedstatestaxpayers of total healthcare spending

just to put that into perspective were paying 162 more than the oecd average on healthcare you seem to be focused on the wrong things"
AskReddit,"every other developed country has universal healthcare 
like all of europe canada australia etc 
it would cost far less than healthcare currently does atm people shell out 20 of their paycheck plus copays and deductibles universal healthcare would only cost 4 of your paycheck and would cut out the additional costs"
AskReddit,you just described the main reason a lot of people are against national healthcare
AskReddit,"you trust private companies that only work toward profit

amazing"
AskReddit,just out of curiosity why do americans come to canada to get insulin everyday the answer is because our insulin is paid for by our goverment in the us a healthcare company sells it to a private company that then raises the price depending how bad its needed you can buy the same insulin in toronto as you can detroit and the cost difference is 30 in canada and 320 in detroit
AskReddit,i feel like you dont understand how paying into healthcare works
AskReddit,what if minimum wage will be so high that people can pay of healthcare and other basic needs
AskReddit,"depends on the va my va has been good about taking my problems seriously and not fucking around when it comes to testing as a woman its refreshing to have doctors that take you seriously from the beginning using private insurance ive had to shop around for doctors that wouldnt listen to me and make repeat appointments to even get tests run 

i think its the fact that civilian doctors can charge per visit and try to string it out while the va knows theyre not going to make money off you so theyd rather take care of business as quickly as possible in one go"
AskReddit," us population has the highest obesity rate in the world

and"
AskReddit,"us isnt even in the top 10 on obesity worldwide

we are top 12 though"
AskReddit,in canada we see universal healthcare as a right
AskReddit,citation needed as relates to healthcare
AskReddit,the fact that all of this might aswe been written in chinese just goes to show how shit healthcare is in the us
AskReddit,"this is my biggest issue with canadian style healthcare 

i am a duel citizen of the us and canada as is my wife we have family living on both sides of the boarder on both sides of our family we are also very lucky in that we have good affordable insurance in the us so i am able to compare our care with theirs 

i am not an expert so i dont know who actually has a higher level of care but i do know we have a more responsive system than our canadian relatives especially for things like nonlife threatening procedures"
AskReddit,"as an american who has worked in tech i have never had to put off getting care but i am not the reason the system needs to change

i know a young woman who gets seizures and works retail she cant afford the doctor visit to get a prescription for the medication to control the seizures so she just lives with the fact that she will collapse on the floor shaking and frothing a couple of times per year

the fact that the aggregate american response to that situation is sucks to be her she should get a job with insurance is inhuman i am a veteran and love my country but how do we get to keep saying how great we are when we are the only wealthy country where medical bankruptcy is a thing that exists and your other choice is to just accept that youre going to seize up periodically and just hope you dont seriously injure yourself"
AskReddit,"although id argue that with the consistently longer wait times canadians face compared to americans you are putting off getting care for financial reasons

this depends on the scope and severity of care needed i can see my gp within a couple days of calling or receive a video call same day specialist have a longer wait time for some things but if its severe they are always on call 

elective surgery or nonessential surgeries have longer wait times hip replacement knee replacement etc but no one is dieing because they have to wait for open heart surgery

i have been to both canadian and american ers and had to wait my turn for both the main difference i witnessed was the american hospital locked the door and i couldnt leave until i had paid thank god i had travel insurance

our system isnt perfect but ive never had to think about taking out a loan for the delivery of either of my children or for surgery ive had in the past"
AskReddit,well you cant blame them its a pandemic and the doctors are probably assisting with the vaccination dist
AskReddit,"saying universal healthcare is socialism is a product of the failure of your education system

theres a difference between socialism and social democracy that most americans apparently dont understand very well 

canada is officially a constitutional monarchy not a socialist country"
AskReddit,im sorry about that if thats just a broken wrist imagine cancer treatment
AskReddit,years  my shattered nerves  i cant begin to imagine that and i am so sorry  canada is always accepting applications
AskReddit,"because you cant just go oh i want to move to x country and do it there are certain requirements for some countries


oh and lets not mention how expensive an international move would be op cant afford the treatment they need so your solution is that they should move to another country as if thats a considerably cheaper option"
AskReddit,bad isnt the right word more so could be better
AskReddit,especially if your employer has decent drug coverage with their benefits am canadian too
AskReddit,"yeah probably because the republicans put forprofit companies in charge of negotiating drug prices for medicare meanwhile government agencies that negotiate their own drug prices get cheaper drugs go figure  
  
edit heres the study about it comparing va drug prices to medicare priceshttpsjamanetworkcomjournalsjamainternalmedicinefullarticle2759734"
AskReddit,out here even now they just go to the emergency rooms then simply dont pay and they go for everything
AskReddit,in ontario canada we have to have a government issued provincial health card  every resident has one  i believe that when a newcomer arrives they get a temporary one until their status is confirmed be it landed immigrant refugee permanent resident etc
AskReddit,"its should be 0 because they shouldnt be here 

that number doesnt include the cost of healthcare for their anchor babies 

plus if we got universal healthcare that would be another magnet for illegal immigrants

i like how you say the numbers are wholly fabricated then proceed to cite them anyway

get off reddit it has melted your brain"
AskReddit,"americans on average are super unhealthy we have crappy desk jobs even if you money its poor diet for everyone and tons of stress

food is fucking questionable sometimes tbh

most americans can barely exercise in their free time

edit ok i list my personal problems here but idk if this is applicable to a ton of people"
AskReddit,"you just described the main reason a lot of people are against national healthcare

health risk factors thats a pretty silly reason to be against a far cheaper more effective system especially given that risk factors arent anywhere near as costly to universal healthcare and the government as people seem to think they are 

the uk recently did a study and they found that from the three biggest healthcare risks obesityhttpsieaorgukthemencodepdfviewerscfilewpcontentuploads201708smokingandthepublicpursepdfsettings111111011langengbpagezoom75pagemode smokinghttpsieaorgukthemencodepdfviewerscfilewpcontentuploads201701obesityandthepublicpursepdfpdfsettings111111011langengbpagezoom75pagemode

none of this really makes much difference though because to the extent these things do create more healthcare spending were already paying for it at a higher rate with private insurance and current taxes"
AskReddit,no but at least i know where my money is going and companies also have their shareholders to answer to theres nothing to prevent the government from taking those additional tax dollars and giving themselves a raise
AskReddit,no but when you have competition then i do
AskReddit,which is why i said i like the idea i dont trust my government not to siphon off funds i thought i expressed that pretty clearly
AskReddit,less healthcare higher death rate less americans
AskReddit,thats reassuring to hear an uplifting story from the va sadly they have too many embarrassing ones
AskReddit,so the government should help
AskReddit,same here in america we just dont pay for people to exercise those rights we dont use tax money to pay for everyone to have firearm rights mean you have the right to not the right for others to pay for it
AskReddit,removed
AskReddit,"for nonlife threatening procedures you have us beat by a landslide we basically dont touch anything until it is life threatening or causes severe impairment of daily living 

for us though its nice to have a guaranteed basic level of care if i get strep throat i can go get an antibiotic at only the cost of the antibiotic which is also maintained at a reasonable price because of our government if i have a heart attack an ambulance will come pick me up at a cost of about 50 and i will be taken care of in the hospital at no cost

canada will make sure you wont die at no cost america can make it so you can actually live but at a cost

some of the best countries seem to work on a 2 tier system because they both have merits"
AskReddit," the fact that the aggregate american response to that situation is sucks to be her she should get a job with insurance

but this is just shit reddit says 

nobody and i mean nobody actually says stuff like that in the real world  i want to improve our healthcare system just as much as you do but we cant do that by ignoring all the many things that work because it goes against the narrative  we also cant do it by ignoring all the many things that dont work in other countrys because it too goes against the narrative"
AskReddit," if its severe they are always on call

severe of course is relative  its a lot easier to tell someone else in excruciating pain with every step they take because theyre in need of a hip replacement that their pain isnt life threatening so an 18 month wait is reasonable to keep costs down  i suspect the person in excruciating pain with every step they take because theyre in need of a hip replacement feels otherwise  

but americans by and large dont have to make those sorts of compromises  wait time in the united states means you had a 100 pm appointment but the doctor is running late so you wont be seen until 115 pm  unfortunately reddit is dominated by american teens or 20somethings and nonamericans who all know basically nothing about our healthcare system and repeat urban myths as if theyre facts  

 the main difference i witnessed was the american hospital locked the door and i couldnt leave until i had paid 

thats obviously a lie as its not even remotely how it works

 our system isnt perfect but ive never had to think about taking out a loan for the delivery of either of my children or for surgery ive had in the past

again neither have i  

my wife gave birth to our fourth child about a month and a half ago  our bill was 200 and that includes the private room for three nights since our daughter was in the nicu"
AskReddit," the main difference i witnessed was the american hospital locked the door and i couldnt leave until i had paid thank god i had travel insurance

our healthcare system is terrible but they were bluffing  people who cant afford regular medical treatment use the er more often because manageable conditions like diabetes escalate to emergencieshttpswwwusnewscomnewshealthnewsarticles20190722avoidableervisitsfuelushealthcarecosts  they dont pay their debt goes into collections and then after a few years it is written off  hospitals get reimbursed through complicated government programs  one hospital had a single patient complete a thousand er visits in three years link is at bottom it contains parenteses

my wife was uninsured and got in a minor car accident a few years ago and went to physical therapy for an airbag injury to her thumbs  she went to the place the er referred her to  everyone in the waiting room was obviously poor and disabled  after the appointment they handed her a bill  or actually handed it to me because my thumbs worked  it was less than two hundred dollars so we decided to pay it on the spot  the person who worked the desk looked at us like we had three heads and had to ask a supervisor how to accept payment  i have no idea how that practice keeps the lights on but they must eventually get paid through some combination of programs like medicare and medicaid  she immediately found another therapist who provided better care but i highly respect the people who worked at that place providing essential care under poor financial conditions   the hand specialist was expensive but agreed to a reasonable up front payment then full reimbursement long afterward when the other drivers insurance paid

it is a total clusterfuck but people dont get locked in the billing office

AskReddit,"oh yeah sorry thats what i meant sorry im bad at conveying sarcasm in writing universal healthcare isnt socialism and healthcare shouldnt be a political matter in the first place


i feel like american politicians just love to use words like socialism and communism to try and scare people who grew up in the cold war era into agreeing with them and voting for them its kind of sad how well it works ive never personally met someone who complains about socialism who can tell me what socialism actually is either which is probably why people cant tell that universal healthcare isnt socialism"

trust me we have considered it i know teacher salaries are much higher"

AskReddit,sure a refugee will receive hospital treatment but they will be in a refugee camp while their asylum bit is treated and if refused they will be deported and if they flee the camp they will not be able to receive treatment or otherwise have interactions with government services and if apprehended be expelled
AskReddit," that number doesnt include the cost of healthcare for their anchor babies

actually it does 

again if what youre most worked up about when were spending 250000 to 500000 more per person on healthcare over a lifetime is 07 of costs even when using trumped up numbers then you really need to reevaluate things 

i like how you say the numbers are wholly fabricated then proceed to cite them anyway

really you dont think thats relevant that even when i use the most ridiculous numbers its still an utterly trivial amount

get off reddit it has melted your brain

considering its not me that has absolutely no sense of reasonable priorities you might want to look in the mirror"
AskReddit,lol sometimes i think the same thing like half my friends on facebook who post about socialized medicine and stuff are all around the fatobese line of health and im like yeah maybe try taking a 45 minute walk everyday instead of watching netflix and youd feel a lot better and wouldnt need to post about having pot legalized because your physical and mental health would vastly improve with some minor changes and you wouldnt need a crutch to get through the day
AskReddit,"americans have the option of eating healthy or not exercising or not they can be as healthy or unhealthy as their lifestyle permits and if they choose to be unhealthy then they pay the price in healthcare services

thats not an argument for or against thats just a statement about the current situation

that said there is a significant portion of the population who believes that if national healthcare were enacted and the government were to be financially responsible for their health that the government would impose regulations on their behavior in order to keep costs down and your comment above confirms that this country being what it is there are a lot of people for whom that is never going to fly"

there is a lot of debate about choice in veterans care but when presented with the details of what choice means veterans reject it eaton said they overwhelmingly believe that the private system will not give them the quality of care they and veterans like them deserve

va health care is as good or in some cases better than that offered by the private sector on key measures including wait times according to a study commissioned by the american legion

 the report issued tuesday and titled a system worth saving concludes that the department of veterans affairs health care system continues to perform as well as and often better than the rest of the us healthcare system on key quality measures including patient safety satisfaction and care coordination

 wait times at most va hospitals and clinics are typically the same or shorter than those faced by patients seeking treatment from nonva doctors the report says

httpswwwmilitarycomdailynews20170920vawaittimesgoodbetterprivatesectorreporthtml

the veterans affairs health care system generally performs better than or similar to other health care systems on providing safe and effective care to patients according to a new rand corporation study

 analyzing a decade of research that examined the va health care system across a variety of quality dimensions researchers found that the va generally delivered care that was better or equal in quality to other health care systems although there were some exceptions

AskReddit,the countries with the best healthcare for their citizens all have public healthcare
AskReddit,"as far as the cost goes it is entirely dependent on the individual 

to give you an idea my wife had complications with the birth of our first child and we had to stay in the hospital for 5 days the total out of pocket we paid was 100 

american healthcare can be the best in the world or it can be cost prohibitive its all on the individual and the type of health insurance they can get thats why the debate is so heated some have it very very good some have it very very bad 


i think on reddit we only hear the cases of the system failing or being horrible very few stories where the system works are shared on here i think that is why it seems so absurd to people outside our country that there is a debate at all they dont realize the system works for many because they never hear about the good sides"
AskReddit,i dont think anyone outside of some very extreme circles actually says it but the aggregate response is not to do anything about the problem so whats the difference between saying it and living it
AskReddit,"thats obviously a lie as its not even remotely how it works

AskReddit,"wait time in the united states means you had a 100 pm appointment but the doctor is running late so you wont be seen until 115 pm

despite spending 250000 to 500000 more per person on a lifetime of healthcare compared to other wealthy countries us wait times arent that great 

the us ranks 6th of 11 out of commonwealth fund countries on er wait times on percentage served under 4 hours 10th of 11 on getting weekend and evening care without going to the er 5th of 11 for countries able to make a same or next day doctorsnurse appointment when theyre sick

httpswwwcihicaencommonwealthfundsurvey2016

americans do better on wait times for specialists ranking 3rd for wait times under four weeks and surgeries ranking 3rd for wait times under four months but that ignores three important factors

 wait times in universal healthcare are based on urgency so while you might wait for an elective hip replacement surgery youre going to get surgery for that life threatening illness quickly 

 nearly every universal healthcare country has strong private options and supplemental private insurance that means that if there is a wait youre not happy about you have options that still work out significantly cheaper than us care which is a winwin

 one third of us familieshttpsnewsgallupcompoll269138americansdelayingmedicaltreatmentduecostaspxutmsourcealertutmmediumemailutmcontentmorelinkutmcampaignsyndication had to put off healthcare due to the cost last year that means more americans are waiting for care than any other wealthy country on earth

AskReddit,"last time i checked immigrating to most countries at least the european countries that have the universal healthcare were talking about required you to have a passportvisa youve got to pack all of your things and pay to have them moved to the new country youve got to pay for your car to be sent too unless youre going to buy a whole new car once you get to your destination a lot of countries require you to have employment lined up before you arrive and i think some may have a similar requirement for housing if i messed something up someone please correct me ive never moved from the us to europe only from europe to the us


this entire process can take years and its expensive there is no logical reason to say that an international move is preferable to op just being able to get absolutely necessary medical attention there is absolutely no valid reason for the us to not have universal healthcare like every other developed country on the face of the earth


you think that the us government should continue horribly misappropriating tax dollars and letting americans suffer because why"
AskReddit,im in ab i think there might be one here too but some of the programs are particular with their requirements here i was unemployed at one point and needed help badly the one program refused me because i owned my home and wasnt renting

AskReddit,"  and the government were to be financially responsible for their health that the government would impose regulations on their behavior in order to keep costs down

AskReddit,i read it it doesnt talk about healthcare anywhere
AskReddit,yeh cuz people need to take their medicine so they dont die theyll pay whatever they need to so your argument is that the price of prescription drugs will go down i agree with you there but what about the quality of care if doctors and nurses get paid less under this new system the quality of care will go down as the smart people wont want to work in that field anymore
AskReddit,i asked about move because this is a clear way to get healthcare it doesnt seem the us providing one available for they any soon asap would be great for many people but the health problems require concrete measures  there may be other actions to certainly archive the goal

AskReddit,"before the money is needed to pay it out at any rate while there are certainly legitimate concerns with social security youre entirely too concerned about the government loaning money to itself its not like its not going to cover its obligations and if the us government stops covering its obligations we have far larger concerns

im still not convinced that cancerleukemia are covered

which has nothing to do with it loaning out money to itself and everything to do with the fact well be paying out more than is taken in with people living longer in retirement and lower birth rates which is something relatively easy to fix even if the solutions are politically unpopular so theyll wait until its dire to do anything"
Conservative,"as a conservative this probably puts me in the minority but i am actually in heavy favor of universal singlepayer healthcare primarily on a philosophical level i do not agree with the notion that healthcare should be tied to employment 

first the united states spends a greater percentage of its gdp on healthcare spending than countries with universal systems not only would uhc be less expensive than what we currently have but would reduce administrative costs produced by private insurers allowing better competition in the market 

second reducing medical bankrupcies would also improve the economic stability of most people and freeing individuals from jobbased insurance would allow better labor market flexibiltiy and more opportunities for entrepreneurship only large organizations benefit from our current system and i am very in favor of allowing workers to have more autonomy in their labor and very in favor of entrepreneurship people do not have greaer individual liberty and personal responsibility when they have to be one paycheck away from financial ruin 

third from a fiscal conservative pov it would reduce longterm government healthcare spending and reduce waste and inefficiency in healthcare administration for small business owners for instance"
Conservative,"it is not as simple as public option vs private insurance vs self pay since ww2 we have trained people to believe that if they didnt have health insurance they didnt have health care we also instituted 3rd party pay systems so no one knows what health care costs or cares because they arent paying the bill in addition politicians have gotten involved and determine what insurance companies can and cant cover and what they must cover the result of the government intervention is continually increasing costs public options dont solve the root causes they just exacerbate them   now add to that litigation which forces the medical community to practice defensive medicine to prevent being sued it is estimated that 85 of medical procedures are ordered to prevent litigation

our healthcare system is broken and needs to be addressed simple solutions like univeral healthcare only cause more unintended consequences"
Conservative,after the last try failed so badly are we willing to give government total control of course not
Conservative,removed
Conservative,"the problem in this whole argument is no one wants to talk about the out of control costs from the healthcare industry putting that cost on the government will eventually cause even bigger problems i would have no problem with public option if we had reasonable health care costs from the bare cost standpoint but when a bottle of pills to treat cancer can cost 14000 dollars we have a whole other issue most of the people arguing this havent even begun to address

this is the issue that must be addressed to even have a reasonable impact on our healthcare issues in this country public versus private is just a side argument"
Conservative,i mean i personally support it but i know most conservatives dont
Conservative,no i still dont see anything in the united states constitution where the government is authorized to run healthcare and i still dont trust the government to not mess up my healthcare
Conservative,"the government could replace employerprovided health insurance by taxing businesses the amount they currently spend on employee health plans this tax revenue would be used to subsidize a range of health insurance options allowing individuals to choose a plan that fits their needs regardless of their job

the goal is to keep overall costs similar to what they are now but with benefits such as more flexibility for workers simplified administration for employers and potentially lower healthcare costs through government negotiation and furthering competition only thing you would need to ensure is enough revenue coming in to replace the amount corporationsbusinesses wouldve been spending already would help smaller businesses and bigger businesses equally while providing individuals with the ability to seek healthcare options to fit their specific needs

along with that open up hsas to everyone however implement a lower limit for nonhigh deductible plans

we might have to implement a  wealth tax on individuals to help subsidizelower costs for individuals who cannot afford it essentially blending medicaidchip into the private market hopefully lowering healthcare spending per capita for taxpayer revenue and outofpocket costs for individuals it also allows for better regulation in the private market but also gives people the choice so you wouldnt need much regulation as bad plans wouldnt be chosen and would need to be worthwhile to compete

  
thats essentially the whole issue with the current system is that youre forced to use the plan negotiated by your employer putting smaller companies at a major disadvantage if you can level the playing field untie it to employers you put everyone in the same market"
Conservative,i think public options dont look as rosy as they did in the early 2000s in european countries due to demographics and budgets you can do polling on satisfaction of things like the nhs in britain and its not good especially relative to how it polled during the obama years
Conservative,"i want to see us at least try a private solution first we have not tried lesser steps a nuclear option is not appropriate


its not okay to just let things fester until you then point to how bad you let them get as evidence you need the right to suspend the rules because its an emergency


but that said i am a firstchance libertarian  there are some functions society must have done  if private industry refuses to make a serious attempt at solving the problem you cannot allow their recalcitrance to lead your society to a communist revolution  


societies allow men to become that desperate at their own peril "
Conservative,i had surgery while on vacation in a country with single payer healthcare where the median income is maybe 70 of the us in asia   5 hospital nights  nurse care  medication and surgery for about 2000 usd   people talk about universal healthcare must be slow and what not but what i saw was that it operated like clockwork and was amazingly efficient compared to the us  i dont think anyone who has seen how some of the better single payer systems operate through experience could ever not think that universal healthcare would be better
Conservative,"the result of the government intervention is continually increasing costs public options dont solve the root causes they just exacerbate them

i really dont think thats true there are countless of countries with universal healthcare where the government is heavily involved in healthcare and insurance and yet average costs are a lot less and while countries like canada arent doing a particularly great job regarding their healthcare system many countries actually have very efficient systems while paying much less per capita than the us and then you have systems like in switzerland where health insurance is managed by private companies but under strict conditions insurance providers have to adhere to

i think what many conservatives fail to understand is that healthcare is an inelastic market if you treat hospitals drugs and health insurance like a any other free market service while allowing monopolies or oligopolies then as a result companies will charge ridiculous prices simply because they can because healthcare is not a luxury people will buy it regardless of the price

thats why healthcare is probably the one service that makes most sense to socialize because it is inelastic service that functions very different than many other indutries in the free market healthcare is not subject to the same forces of supply of demand as most other sectors"
Conservative,doesnt it seem universal healthcare works pretty well in other countries  i hear things like that there are waits for care but i have had a lot of random health issues pop up in the last 5 years and there have been very long waits for everything with insurance  i was very uncomfortable for 6 months waiting for a surgery a couple of  years ago  it wasnt a life threatening issue so i just had to wait  not to mention my insurance randomly denies things  plus i have a several thousand dollar deductible every year before insurance pays a dime  i cant see how universal healthcare could be worse than that  i fully believe it would be much better
Conservative,so if you dont like government intervention are you ok with removing medicare medicaid and military tricare
Conservative,what unintended consequences are caused by uhc
Conservative,how was it a failure the satisfaction ratings of medicare and medicaid are actually pretty high and medicare costs around 20 less per person than private insurance how has it been a failure
Conservative,last try so you are ok with getting rid of medicare medicaid and military tricare
Conservative,"your submission was removed because you do not have any user flair please select appropriate flair and then try again  if you are confused as to what flair suits you best simply choose rightwing leftwing or independent howdoigetuserflairhttpssupportreddithelpcomhcenusarticles205242695howdoigetuserflair


i am a bot and this action was performed automatically please contact the moderators of this subredditmessagecomposetoraskconservatives if you have any questions or concerns"
Conservative,the public option would be government run and single payer and as it becomes more popular they would have better negotiating power as well like medicaid medicare and tricare so you would be in favor of that vs private insurance
Conservative,but the constitution also does not prohibit the government from providing certain services if medicare and medicaid were unconstitutional the conservative supreme court would have most definitely struck it down the us government also runs amtrak and usps healthcare is already a mess in the us isnt it and while certain countries like canada are doing an awful job running a universal healthcare system many other countries actually have very efficient healthcare systems at much lower costs per capita plus i would also add the fact that 3545000 americans are dying each year due to lack of health insurance is morally reprehensible
Conservative,you know this sounds a lot like bernies plan right
Conservative,medicare medicaid and military tricare have the highest satisfaction scores vs all private insurers they have lower costs as well vs expenses
Conservative,the us has utilized private insurers for almost a century im not sure how much longer you want to try this out
Conservative,"i think universal healthcare would work better at the state level seeing as those countries that it works in like norway have a population of 5 million same population size of colorado 

it sounds like youre on a high deductible plan if you have health issues wouldnt you benefit better from a ppo plan it may mean more out of your paycheck but less being paid towards doctors and maybe even better innetwork options to choose from if you see a provider out of network that can mean insurance not paying anything towards your bill"
Conservative,"the problem with these comparisons is that they dont compare apples to apples your anecdotal evidence in not sufficient to make a determination about which system is best you can say you think it would be better but based on what 

in the us the top 5 causes of death are preventable how does univeral healthcare fix that

how does univeral healthcare fix the litigation problem

a single payer system does not have unlimited funds and we all know that when something is free people use it more so logically if we have single payer universal free healthcare that the only way to control costs is to ration care that is what you are promoting

healthcare is a very complicated nuanced issue and a onesizefitsall top down government run program is not the aswer imo"
Conservative,after personally working with people who had these government health insurances worked for a company that sold medical equipment i can say theyre not all that great coverage is terrible and definitely need to be improved upon before a universal healthcare plan can be put in place
Conservative,"1 rationing

2 fewer healthcare practitioners

3 fewer drugs as prices are capped

4 bureaucratic costs of single payer

the market works why not let it work"
Conservative,obamacare failed  both to bend the cost curve and to provide insurance for everyone
Conservative,how do you know their negotiating power would overcome the high costs youre assuming concept is one thing actually nuts and bolts is another and i wouldnt be in favor of eliminating private just having a public option
Conservative,bernies plan is a government run plan with a 4 premium tax on everyone stock market trading tax along with 23 other various taxes
Conservative,"we have never tried to get rid of the real culprit though 


the paternalistic daddyknowsbest culture of medicine and the fact how we train doctors to this day is literally based on a coke addict who thought sleep was not a human necessity is the problem "
Conservative,why does population matter wheres the cutoff 5 million 10 million medical bankruptcies arent a thing in china or india so why does it work better there with 34x the population than in the us
Conservative,it is anecdotal but i know so many people who have medical bills long waits and high deductibles  my situation is not at all unusual  i would gladly switch to government run healthcare  it cant be worse than fighting with insurance companies and paying thousands a year for care  the insurance companies already ration care when they decide you dont need this or that
Conservative,"in the us the top 5 causes of death are preventable how does univeral healthcare fix that

part of the reason the us doesnt invest enough in preventative healthcare is because private payers have little incentive to do so more likely than not a patient will switch insurance every few years so a payer who invests in preventative healthcare will not necessarily yield the benefits of that investment which may come 1020 years down the line a government system of healthcare has a lot more incentive to make those investments because theyre on the hook for the eventual consequences of poor health"
Conservative,"the problem with these comparisons is that they dont compare apples to apples your anecdotal evidence in not sufficient to make a determination about which system is best you can say you think it would be better but based on what

no but its sufficient enough to determine that we are the among the worst in a great many categories relative to our peer nations 


in the us the top 5 causes of death are preventable how does universal healthcare fix that

with preventative care 

universal free healthcare that the only way to control costs is to ration care

every uhc country also reduces the cost of services and products through negotiation the cost of labor is not the reason why an mri costs 210x more in the us than other countries  

healthcare is a very complicated nuanced issue and a onesizefitsall top down government run program is not the aswer imo

yes it is but its not hard to recognize that every single nation with universal healthcare and high government intervention achieves cheaper health care and often better than the us 

uhc is worthy of consideration because of this if the us was a business and all of your competitors achieved 12 price cost of goods that you do youd be a bad business person if you didnt try and find out why so you could replicate"
Conservative,"in the us the top 5 causes of death are preventable how does universal healthcare fix that

more data is needed we need to know the rate of insured vs uninsured in each category we also need to know how often these categories are preventable through regular checkups and monitoring

we then can start to formulate an educated opinion on this catagoery more data will be beed to build a full one but thats where we would need to start"
Conservative,"medicare medicaid and tricare have the highest satisfaction rates vs all other insurers and have the lowest cost to expense ratios verified by the cbo

its also harder to improve when these benefits solely rely on taxing middle class income instead of higher earners and businesses"
Conservative,why would these things happen
Conservative,the market doesnt work as costs have increased and care has decreased and also why 30 of all medical bankruptcies are filed from individuals with insurance
Conservative,well first of all obamacare was never intended to provide insurance to everyone it was meant to provide healthcare and make healthcare affordable to more people and it has very much achieved that and its mostly republicanrun states that are trying to make it extra hard for people to access medicaid and obamacare has absolutely reigned in prices obamacare is on average i believe 22 cheaper per person than private insurance so obamacare is absolutely superior to private insurance most of the time theres some things that it may not cover but it absolutely outperforms most insurance plans in terms of value for money
Conservative,the actual costs of all medical care is based on negotiated contracts theres a reason why medicare medicaid and tricare have lower costs negotiating contracts on behalf of 100 million always beats out private insurers with a fraction of customers
Conservative,other developed countries spend a lot less on healthcare in terms of  of gdp that proves its possible this is a literal supplyside argument and there is proof it works  and yes in those cases you still want private options i agree
Conservative,a lot would depend on who the government puts in charge of negotiations you cant put someone there whos friendly with connections to big pharma and hospitals you would have to prevent corporate capture
Conservative,"i dont actually care for bernies plan 

but the studies showed that it would result in a net savings overall for most normal people as well as a net savings in total costs at the societal level"
Conservative,as a trained doctor i couldnt disagree with you more we are trained based on evidence based medicine
Conservative,"a cohesive and agreeing populace helps as well you get that more state by state rather than a country as diverse as ours in said other coutnries both left and right want uhc thats not the case here we cant even agree on the 1st and 2nd amendment much anymore

so its not just a population thing its a communal thing and a country such as ours that was founded on individual freedom and responsibility is it any wonder why nationally such a thing doesnt fly"
Conservative,"its easier to supply universal healthcare and have it work well to a smaller group of people than to a large group of people less peopleless money plus norway is a rich oil country thats why itd be easier to leave universal healthcare up to the states rather than the federal government 

just because there arent any official medical bankruptcies doesnt mean people in china and india arent struggling with medical debt many studies show that middle and low class peoples are struggling with medical debt"
Conservative,"this is largely captured in amenable mortality statisticshttpswwwhealthsystemtrackerorgindicatorqualitymortalityamenablehealthcare literally deaths that are preventable with timely treatment  

the us is the worst among all first worlds nations by far"
Conservative,exactly my point healthcare is much too complicated and nuanced for a one size fits all top down government run program
Conservative,"well when its practically free healthcare most respondents will say positive things about it to continue receiving it but when it comes to necessary items like medical equipment it doesnt cover really anything or the lowest crappiest version 

employers must pay towards those services too people with higher incomes typically have to pay an additional tax as well its not just the middle class funding medicare medicaid and tricare"
Conservative,"1 rationing happens when you dont ave enough revenue to pay for all the care demanded a single payer system doesnt have unlimited funds in order to reduce costs they ration care

2 if you reduce what doctors can charge part of ratining you reduce the number of doctors because doctors refuse to practice unless they can make an income that can justify 12 years of school

3 if you cap the price a drug company can charge for a new drug there is no incentive to invest 1 billion in developing new drugs

4 what does the bureaucracy to pay claims for 330 million people cost no one knows"
Conservative,"costs have increased and care has decreased as a direct result of government intervention in the market

costs have increased because with 3rd party payer systems no one cares what healthcare costs

we dont have price transparency we dont allow markets to work

a good example of markets working in healthcare is lasik eye surgery since lasik was considered cosmetic it was not covered by insurance the market worked since lasik was introduced in the 70s the procedure has become more common and cheaper that is how markets are supposed to work"
Conservative,from 2013 to 2019 the individual market prices more than doubled while the large employer market only 29 httpswwwheritageorghealthcarereformreportobamacarehasdoubledthecostindividualhealthinsurance
Conservative,but the government has to reimburse the people making the product in the first place hence the contract again the incentive for the pharmaceutical company or hospital hasnt been considered
Conservative,well again this is all left to chance and assuming they can work with them
Conservative,"savings for most people over the span of your entire lifetime

as a single male making 50000 paying only around 1200 in healthcare premiums and expenses yoy i would see about an 8001000 increase in healthcare related expenses even if i didnt use them

but yes for some people especially low income or people with preexisting conditions along with elderly and others would see solid savings most likely

very expensive though our healthcare estimates have been off by 30 percent in the past on rough calculations"
Conservative,"i dont object to how we train doctors except their hours and how abusive med school and especially internship can be


and i dont think any doctor would deny that the hours they are expected to keep show that they came from a stimulant addict


what i object to is doctors being hard gatekeepers of all acess to medical information and treatment


and we are already seeing reforms like practices having rn advice lines and the creation of the category of lpn


thats what i mean i want less things to take prescriptions more things to be in competency for an lpn to do more things being delegatable etc


basically i want doctors to be the second line of care not the very first and to use lower cost means to handle routine 


for instance i am not a complicated case i need lisinopril but my blood pressure is very well controlled by it  i am actively losing large amounts of weight i am no longer obese medically for instwncr 


i just paid 409 dollars to refill my lisinopril a paramedic could have told anyone this was medically appropriate given all other labs are in range and i am asymptomatic for anything i did not need to waste a doctor that could have tended to a more severe complicated or medically fragile patient that needs more than a short conversation and a refill script "
Conservative,ask anyone with state medicaid or private insurance about getting medical help in a different state theyre either not covered or pay penalties you shouldnt have to worry about getting medical care if you already have medical insurance contracts are what runs the medical industry
Conservative," its easier to supply universal healthcare and have it work well to a smaller group of people than to a large group of people less peopleless money 




in a publically paid healthcare system why would that not scale 

just because there arent any official medical bankruptcies doesnt mean people in china and india arent struggling with medical debt many studies show that middle and low class peoples are struggling with medical debt


in regards to china there seems to be a study about thathttpswwwncbinlmnihgovpmcarticlespmc7344870


namely


we found that 242 of middleincome families had medical debt averaging us627825 or 056 times average household yearly income and 392 of lowincome families had medical debts averaging us541988 which was equivalent to 249 times average household yearly income

the concentration index for low and middleincome families medical debt was significantly propoor medical debt impoverished about 10 of all nonpoverty households and pushed poverty households deeper into poverty 



compare it to a study in americahttpswwwncbinlmnihgovpmcarticlespmc8293024


in this retrospective analysis of credit reports for a nationally representative 10 panel of individuals an estimated 178 of individuals in the us had medical debt in collections in june 2020 reflecting care provided prior to the covid19 pandemic

medical debt was highest among individuals who lived in the south and in zip codes in the lowest income deciles and became more concentrated in lowerincome communities in states that did not expand medicaid"
Conservative,figured
Conservative,who has more negotiating power humana with 17 million customers or a single payer for 350 million customers
Conservative,medical equipment is even harder to get covered through private insurers theyll make you go through the ringer before they pay
Conservative,"1 rationing happens when you dont ave enough revenue to pay for all the care demanded a single payer system doesnt have unlimited funds in order to reduce costs they ration care

rationing can and does happenin the us too but uhc countries also negotiate to reduce the price of services and products which is where the majority of the savings come from for example we pay higher costs of drugs and things like mris which can cost 210x more here than in other countries 

2 if you reduce what doctors can charge part of ratining you reduce the number of doctors because doctors refuse to practice unless they can make an income that can justify 12 years of school 

the us actually has fewer doctors per capita than most uhc countries we rank in the bottom 25th percentile with 26 doctors per capita vs 36 doctors per capita for the oecd averagehttpswwwoecdilibraryorgdoctorsoverallnumberb39949d7enpdfitemid2fcontent2fcomponent2fb39949d7enmimetypepdf other countries incentivize the training of new healthcare workers we on the other have a literal effective cap on the number of new doctors lobbied by doctors  uhc would lead to a strong incentive to train new workers and get rid of these perverse caps 


3 if you cap the price a drug company can charge for a new drug there is no incentive to invest 1 billion in developing new drugs

plenty of investment in other countries as well total healthcare rd is like 250 billion in the us thats 5 of our total national healthcare expenditure research does not drive our healthcare costs at all 

other nations also put up respectable numbers its mostly correlated to gdp bigger economy  more research although the us does in fact put up more than its share 

4 what does the bureaucracy to pay claims for 330 million people cost no one knows

currently the private admin and profit motive accounts for about 50httpswwwcommonwealthfundorgpublicationsissuebriefs2023octhighushealthcarespendingwhereisitallgoing of the difference between the spend in the us and spend in the average peer country were talking like a trillion dollars in total here spent on private admin and profit the admin costs in every peer country are significantly lower than the us 

so what will it cost no one knows but its much less than what we have now"
Conservative," rationing happens when you dont ave enough revenue to pay for all the care demanded a single payer system doesnt have unlimited funds in order to reduce costs they ration care




except does this not happen in private healthcare as well except there is an additional factor in being able to pay not to mention isnt triage a standard medical practice


2 if you reduce what doctors can charge part of ratining you reduce the number of doctors because doctors refuse to practice unless they can make an income that can justify 12 years of school


under a single payer system doctors are paid by the state they wouldnt really charge the end consumer in developed countries being a doctor is a well paid job



3 if you cap the price a drug company can charge for a new drug there is no incentive to invest 1 billion in developing new drugs



but again the state is paying for or negotiating the price sure the end user pays less but that doesnt mean thats what the real price is



4 what does the bureaucracy to pay claims for 330 million people cost no one knows


would that not depend on if a system of pay claims is used also unless something catastrophic happens 330 million people wouldnt use healthcare all at once"
Conservative,i agree with the need for price transparency however its not applicable for emergency situations you cant shop around if youre having a medical emergency
Conservative,no one cares what healthcare costs private insurers dont care what theyre paying for how are they making record profits every year then private insurers are known for denying claims due to costs andor reducing reimbursements
Conservative,"didnt expect the heritage foundation to explain the full story but here are some things to consider as to why prices increased after the aca forcing insurers to cover preexisting conditions which actually forced an insurer to provide healthcare and essential healthcare benefits so more comprehensive plans saw in increase in costs less competition because those cheaper health plans that couldnt meet the bare minimum in providing healthcare for their clients were cancelled the market place exchange benefitted most but those outside certain qualification couldnt get subsidized plans thus higher premiums states that didnt expand medicaid 90 republican led states saw increased premiums because those people had to buy private insurance 

but after all this the rates of insurance premiums drastically reduced or stayed the same 85 of all marketplace enrollees saw their premiums go down from previous years"
Conservative,and reimbursements vary depending on contracts most insurers overcharge to maximize those reimbursements stronger negotiating power means youll get closer to paying actual costs
Conservative,"your numbers are wrong

the tax would have been on taxable income only use the standard deduction which everyone gets of 14600 for a single person and your taxable income is lowered to 35400 meaning your 4 tax would be 1416 216 a year higher than 1200 

use 216 worth of healthcare during that year and youd break even thats like 2 doctors visits and some tests pretty much everyone uses that much care or if you dont you frankly should as it pays off down the line  

furthermore 1200 a year in premiums is quite low the average employee side premium contribution in the us is 1637httpswwwkfforgotherstateindicatorsinglecoveragecurrenttimeframe0sortmodel7b22colid2222location2222sort2222asc227d

so a random average person making 50k and paying the average premiums of 1637 would come out 221 ahead before they even used healthcare"
Conservative,"medical doctors review all staff interventions by lpns and rns 

and no you did not pay 409 for lisinopril even a 90 day supply of their highest strength 40mg 180 tabs is under 32 per goodrx"
Conservative," ask anyone with state medicaid or private insurance about getting medical help in a different state

plenty on the right including those in congress have wanted tort reform and cross state line insurance allowance"
Conservative,"because it would end up being a single payer healthcare system like canada has and be a disaster 

so we agree that medical debt will still exist no matter what"
Conservative,"who cares if you think that a government run program can fix prices you dont understand economics fixing prices by negotiating prices below costs will lead to shortages and a decline in care not the opposite we are already seeing this in medicare medicare determines how many patients a doctor needs to see and how much he will be paid either doctors are quitting because they cant offer quality care in 15 minutes or they are offering substandard care 

as i said healthcare is way to complicated for a one size fits all solution"
Conservative,with your first example i can choose another company if i wanted in your second i have no choice and i dont want my medical issues levied against my neighbor who doesnt have a choice
Conservative,i always had much better luck with getting medical equipment covered under insurances like united healthcare cigna blue cross blue shield etc than medicare and medicaid i remember helping my mom deal with my grandmas medical equipment hospitalstyle bed for inhome hospice care and medicare covering barely any of it my mom checked with her plan united and it was covered almost fully under that needless to say she was very upset
Conservative,"medicare is basically a check writing enterprise the health care provider requests payment medicare pays the bill last year medicare fraud was estimated at 100 billion 

single payer doesnt work"
Conservative,that is true which is why i would support catastrophic health insurance policies just like fire insurance for your house we need to do away with first dollar healthcare insurance
Conservative,yes banning low cost plans meant higher costs just as we predicted
Conservative,but you arent getting it his doctor told him the real cost of the pills is 14 grand per bottle the insurance covers it aside for 60 dollars out of my dads pocket how will the government control those sorts of costs on the back side and how will this not overload the government with insane unheard of amounts of costs to them
Conservative,"thats like 2 doctors visits and some tests

2 doctor visits is 20 each and some tests my full blood lab was only 25 

so still higher and as i go through my career the cost difference will only get worse

the problem is with estimates as i mentioned before the government does a horrible job of estimating costs medicaid expansion was believed to cost 900 billion over 10 years then 4 years later that was updated to 14 trillion 4 is quite literally the case scenario lol look at any other modern country that provides government healthcare and their taxes are usually double that at the federal level not accounting for municipal or sales taxes that also go to healthcare spending

not to mention the lower standard of care anyone with an already good plan would see if forcibly swapped to a government plan if the dollar is taken out of your paycheck without question

not to mention the plan increasing taxes on businesses and lowering deductions you can make which will increase cost of living and decrease usable income the fact that he has about 8 different taxes to pay for m4a over a 10 year span shows how barely viable it is you have one rough economic year and government is in the hole big time"
Conservative,"i should be more clear

i paid 409 dollars for the pcp visit necessary for a refill to be issued

i paid 0 dollars for the actual lisinopril 

  
that is my problem i should not have to waste money and time my time and a doctors going to a pcp every 6 months for control of wellcontrolled blood pressure with no comorbidities"
Conservative,getting insurance across state lines is allowed its about utilizing said insurance just because you have health insurance doesnt mean you have healthcare
Conservative," because it would end up being a single payer healthcare system like canada has and be a disaster 




currently canadians live to about 82 from firsthand experience it hardly seems a disaster"
Conservative,if you work for a company thats only contracted with humana you dont have a choice unless you want to pay for another insurer which wont be subsidized or the market exchange which still may not be subsidized based on the individual under single payer youll get to choose from a much wider and affordable option because most medical facilities will be contracted most facilities arent turning away a contract of 350 million potential customers
Conservative," with your first example i can choose another company if i wanted in your second i have no choice 




how so doesnt this assume other private insurers would be made illegal"
Conservative," medicare is basically a check writing enterprise the health care provider requests payment medicare pays the bill 




except medicare exists as a service tacked onto a preexisting system 


single payer doesnt work



does the incidence of fraud mean something doesnt work"
Conservative,private healthcare fraud was 68 billion last year according to the nhcaa fraud isnt unique to government entities
Conservative,so you want to get rid of preventative healthcare
Conservative,every low cost plan didnt cover the basics or preexisting conditions those plans were the definition of health insurance without healthcare benefits
Conservative,im not sure what youre asking pharmaceutical industries can charge whatever they want and a lot of them overcharge a lot of pharmacies overcharge as well as hospitals theres many ways to lower costs not just negotiating power but buying in bulk encouraging competition regulations formulary management etc everything is pooled so that 14000 is paid by all enrollees whether it comes from taxes or your premiums deductive from your paycheck
Conservative,literally every other country does this and achieves much lower costs via negotiation why do you think the us cant
Conservative,"2 doctor visits is 20 each and some tests my full blood lab was only 25

so you have a lower than average premium and no deductible before costsharing sure sounds like your employer is picking up the extra tab for the nicer plan for the record the average individual premium in missouri where im guessing youre from is even higher then the national average at 1701yr perhaps this is worse for you personally but for most its better 

the problem is with estimates as i mentioned before the government does a horrible job of estimating costs

yea dude it was libertarian think thank who hated the plan that came up with those numbers indicating m4all would save net money 

not to mention the lower standard of care anyone with an already good plan would see if forcibly swapped to a government plan if the dollar is taken out of your paycheck without question

almost all first world uhc countries get better care than we do at least on average  

the fact that he has about 8 different taxes to pay for m4a over a 10 year span shows how barely viable it is

this is a nonsensical statement 

you have one rough economic year and government is in the hole big time

plenty of rough economic years elsewhere those systems are still chugging along saving providing higher quality of life than the us"
Conservative,going from private to single payer doesnt change the diagnostic and treatment procedures we do everything based on guidelines which all include monitoring parameters high blood pressure is a silent killer that needs monitoring so seeing your pcp once every 6 months to make sure there are no changes you and the medical team arent aware of is the minimum
Conservative," just because you have health insurance doesnt mean you have healthcare

because insurance shouldnt be for a routine doctor vist or the sniffles someone elsewhere a towards the top comment mentioned this in a way that we have been conditioned to think insurance  healthcare i doesnt and shouldnt and i shouldnt be on the hook for your problems"
Conservative,then please explain why so many of them come over the border to receive healthcare treatment here if their uhc is so good they shouldnt have a reason to i wouldnt use average age of death as a good comparison
Conservative," if you work for a company thats only contracted with humana you dont have a choice unless you want to pay for another insurer which wont be subsidized or the market exchange which still may not be subsidized based on the individual

still a choice

under single payer youll get to choose from a much wider and affordable option because most medical facilities will be contracted most facilities arent turning away a contract of 350 million potential customers

doctors routinely dont accept medicare or was it medicaid one or the other

if i dont want insurance i shouldnt have to buy it and yes leave me to deal with the consequences with no government assistancebailout same goes for ss

there is no choice when it make it governmenttax payer funded and controlled do it state by statehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvu1tal7ohvem easier to leave a state than leave a country"
Conservative,"doesnt this assume other private insurers would be made illegal

harris herself has said to do away with it why would i assume they would still exist

also if they did exist then said payers for private insurance shouldnt be paying for government insurance they themselves dont use so yea i shouldnt be paying for ss or medicare because im not using it i should pay for schools and roads because im using them

no im not going to explain that further because this is my viewpoint and world view not my congressional campaign plan"
Conservative,no i just think people should pay for it themselves
Conservative,people are uninsured because of the high cost and a reason for the high cost is all the mandates so banning low cost insurance can also result in no coverage as often as better coverage
Conservative,but then we are putting that tax regulation onto the government
Conservative,because those countries are often smaller and as a result of funding those reimbursements they have much higher taxes which has other ripple effects through their economy
Conservative,"nope im from virginia plan is bcbs minnesota

almost all uhc countries rely on the us for medical advancements sounds bad but we reduce or let the government control the amount of money in the healthcare industry you will either need to subsidize it or say byebye

sure average standard of care is better because government regulates it instead of competitionstock market top line care is undoubtedly better in the us

not sure why i would want to pay more for a lower standard of care just so someone else can have it as well just doesnt make financial sense

my comment about the tax is you rely on all of those estimates to be true none of which accounts for those taxes negatively effecting specific sectors reducing revenue to pay for the plan 

5 years down the line and government isnt breaking even they just increase payroll tax when do you call quits on an ineffective system like that

im talking specifically about my health insurance and it would be dumb for me to support this policy when it would negatively affect me in every aspect"
Conservative,if you have private insurance youre also paying for others your premium is pooled your claims are taken from that pool you are taking care of others whether you know it or not this is how every insurance company works whether its healthcare automobile home etc
Conservative," then please explain why so many of them come over the border to receive healthcare treatment here if their uhc is so good they shouldnt have a reason to



expediency presumably the main benefit of private healthcare is that if you can pay you get seen quicker



however canada seems to be a destination for medical tourism for americans as well it seems the most popular onehttpswwwmedicaltourismcommtihome"
Conservative,that just doesnt make any sense filing for medical bankruptcy just shifts the healthcare costs onto those with insurance whether its government or private
Conservative," harris herself has said to do away with it 



ill look it up but do you have a source for this



generally countries with universal healthcare have and welcome private insurance



also if they did exist then said payers for private insurance shouldnt be paying for government insurance they themselves dont use 


but theyll still benefit from it"
Conservative,and if they cant afford it they have to suffer the consequences of an emergency thats not very costs effective or good use of resources
Conservative,would your auto insurance cover your vehicle if there were no seat belts thats why we have mandates you keep conflating health insurance with healthcare banning those fraud plans protected people from going under when those insurers would eventually fail to pay
Conservative,and its still pooled
Conservative,"because those countries are often smaller

the eu has a larger population than the us and similar levels of geographic diversity theyre also a loose collection of countries analogous to our states but not quite it works fine there 

reimbursements they have much higher taxes which has other ripple effects through their economy

oh sorry youre going to need to try again 

americans pay so much for healthcare that the taxes we pay for the public healthcare sector alone are more than what our peer countries pay in total for both public and private healthcare 

1 total national health expenditure was 45 trillion in 2022httpswwwcmsgovdataresearchstatisticstrendsandreportsnationalhealthexpendituredatanhefactsheet 173 of the entire us economy 

2 total public spending on healthcare in the us total is 2314 trillion or 514  of total spending click above link and sum up the public programs

3 there were 3333 million people in the us in 2022httpswwwgooglecomsearchquspopulation2022rlz1c1ongrenus1051us1051oquspopulation2022gslcrpegzjahjvbwuybggaeeuyotigcaeqrrha0geinza2nmowajeoagcwagasourceidchromeieutf8 

4 that works out to 7012 per capita in public spending funded by taxes 

5 in 2022 the comparable first world countries all of whom have universal healthcare the average purchasing price parity adjusted cost per capita was 6651httpswwwhealthsystemtrackerorgchartcollectionhealthspendinguscomparecountrieshealth20expenditures20per20capita20us20dollars20ppp20adjusted202022

yes if the us were as cost efficient as our peer countries our taxes would actually go down 

were talking literally trillions of dollars that the us pays for healthcare more than our peer countries do you can bet that wasted money has ripple effects on our economy it drags down it down it could be invested into infrastructure but instead its wasted mostly on corporate profits"
Conservative,"minnesota

1537 premiums on average at your earning figures the average person still saves money

almost all uhc countries rely on the us for medical advancements 

nope i work in the healthcare rd sector i have colleagues all over the world this is a straight false hard nope 

yes the us does put out a lot of research however total medical and healthcare rd from both public and private sector is 2451 billion dollarshttpswwwresearchamericaorgwpcontentuploads202209researchamericainvestmentreportfinaljanuary20221pdf thats like 54 of our national healthcare expenditure of 45 trillion in no way does our research activity drive our total healthcare costs

for the record the rest of the world puts up respectable numbers as well the us puts in more on average but mostly its correlated to gdp since we have a higher gdp we put in more money 

sure average standard of care is better because government regulates it instead of competitionstock market top line care is undoubtedly better in the us not sure why i would want to pay more for a lower standard of care just so someone else can have it as well just doesnt make financial sense

yes top care can be if and only if you can afford it trust me it aint costing only 1500 its likely your level of care would remain about the same 

my comment about the tax is you rely on all of those estimates to be true none of which accounts for those taxes negatively effecting specific sectors reducing revenue to pay for the plan

there are also economic benefits to decoupling healthcare from employment more people will start their own business more smaller businesses will be viable when they dont have to compete with the big boys on benefit levels decoupling healthcare means higher velocity of employees job hopping  which is associated with higher pay 

having benefits coupled to employment has done a lot to keep people in place and therefore down on the wage scale 

5 years down the line and government isnt breaking even they just increase payroll tax when do you call quits on an ineffective system like that

its has worked fine in every other country in the world no real reason it wont work here we already pay so much in taxes that our public healthcare taxes alone are more than what our peer countries spend in total for both private and public care if we were as price efficient as our peer countries our taxes would actually go down there is little reason to believe that uhc will make total costs go significantly up in the long term 

im talking specifically about my health insurance and it would be dumb for me to support this policy when it would negatively affect me in every aspect

perhaps but i highly doubt it in net for example lets say youre ever unemployed given your numbers for minnesota and a savings of 216yr it would take just 2 weeks of unemployment for you wipe out those savings thats assuming prices stay as there are the long term benefit of uhc is that it has driven effectively down the prices of services over time 

youd also have a hell of an easier time starting a business if you werent beholden to huge healthcare costs at the start i would know i started one and paid for all healthcare insurance out of pocket its why ive researched so much into our healthcare system its insane just how bad of a deal it is for america"
Conservative,if i want to why are you not grasping that point
Conservative," and yes leave me to deal with the consequences with no government assistancebailout

i didnt say anything about bankruptcy i said the opposite"
Conservative,"they welcome it because they know government only cant provide for all

just as those on the left dont believe in trickle down i dont believe in roi or whatever harriss new bs line is"
Conservative,"not really anyone who shows up in the er is treated whether they can afford it or not 

im talking about routine preventative medicine most people can afford routine preventative care"
Conservative,there are levels of auto insurance if you outlawed the cheaper auto insurance plans then more people would go without sometimes something is better than nothing
Conservative,"this doesnt even address patent issues with how pharma companies use their patent for up to 20 years to jack the price and then drop it drastically once the patent expires any government program has to deal with that

why would people want more taxes this seems like such a utopian view of things government will make it okay"
Conservative,"why are you working with averages

im explaining why i dont support it based on my financial situation lol

us is responsible for some 40 of medical patents

my level of care would remain the same however my costs would increase drastically over time as i earn more

the economic benefits of uhc arent shown in most european nations where they have experienced near economic stagnation for a decade most uhc plans essentially tax companies what they wouldve already spent on healthcare anyway

im not wanting to ever start a business the chance of me needing health insurance during unemployment is very low"
Conservative,if you want to what buy insurance you dont have to
Conservative,how much can you afford to pay out of pocket for any procedure or medical emergency
Conservative," they welcome it because they know government only cant provide for all
 
 



cant not necessarily depends on the country makes it easier yes


just as those on the left dont believe in trickle down i dont believe in roi or whatever harriss new bs line is



sure but its not like developed places with universal healthcare are doing badly there is precedence for universal healthcare being advantageous"
Conservative,"scans bloodwork xrays cultures etc are part of routine preventative care they can be in the thousands 

overrunning our ers the most expensive form of healthcare because of something that should be routine is not free if someone cant afford it the costs gets past on in the form of higher costs of drugs medical equipment services to those with insurance"
Conservative,that something is nothing though medical bankruptcy should not be a thing you have insurance to protect you from going under those plans protected and covered nothing
Conservative,"why are you working with averages

because this a discussion about if itll save money for most normal people which it would have 

im explaining why i dont support it based on my financial situation lol

significant medical expenses will hit you one day too youre betting your small yearly savings against giant bills youll lose that bet 9 times out of 10 over the course of a lifetime 

us is responsible for some 40 of medical patents

its actually 437 for drugs and it accounts for about 40 of the gdp among innovator nationshttpswwwncbinlmnihgovpmcarticlespmc2866602 the us slightly outperforms its gdp contribution 

 however my costs would increase drastically over time as i earn more

healthcare premiums gets more expensive with age dude 

the economic benefits of uhc arent shown in most european nations where they have experienced near economic stagnation for a decade most uhc plans essentially tax companies what they wouldve already spent on healthcare anyway

um 10 year gdp growth in the euhttpsdataworldbankorgindicatornygdpmktpppcdlocationseu1699x appears to be higher than in the united stateshttpsdataworldbankorgindicatornygdpmktpppcdlocationsus1621x the difference is even greater when going back 20 yearseu 245x vs us 238x i used current ppp adjusted figures 


most uhc plans essentially tax companies what they wouldve already spent on healthcare anyway

you forgot that they achieve universal coverage at literally half the net price the us healthcare system is an actual drag on our economy it takes away from investment in other areas 

also everyone is covered unlike the us where 43httpswwwforbescomsitesjoshuacohen20240101ushealthcaresystemleavesfartoomanypeopleunderinsured of people are underinsured the population is healthier as a result healthcare in europe is also just generally better than in the us 

there are also far fewer medical bankruptcies 

an increase in job change velocity which can be associated with net wage increase 

tons of benefits"
Conservative,"exactly so this 

if you have private insurance youre also paying for others your premium is pooled your claims are taken from that pool you are taking care of others whether you know it or not this is how every insurance company works whether its healthcare automobile home etc

doesnt apply making it government mandated would make it so so hard pass"
Conservative,"you really arent reading much of what im typing are you ill explain better

insurance shouldnt be for medical routine anything or a cold it should be for catastrophic only we dont pay car insurance for new tires or an oil change we pay for an unforseen circumstance same should absolutely apply to healthcare"
Conservative,"there is precedence for universal healthcare being advantageous

in a homogenous communal oriented society where it doesnt matter which side of the political spectrum you are on that wants it yes thats why you see people say do it state by state not federally"
Conservative,depending on how you measure medical bankruptcy is rare
Conservative,"world bank data isnt even loading for me eu data is different from data i was considering because eu has developing countries within it that grow at a faster rate
us is growing faster than uk france germany spain and i believe all of the nordic countries is what i was mainly referring to i guess the eu average works though

this discussion was never about the average person lol i was explaining my financial situation and whether it would be dumb or smart for me to support such policy

significant medical bills i work in a field that provides me with lifetime health insurance after 20 years along with a pension it wont hit me as hard as what youre thinking

our medical system doctors and nurses wages are about double that of most developed eu countries that probably contributed to being half the cost do you think we should pay them much less"
Conservative,youll be filing for medical bankruptcy when you cant pay and thus shifting the costs onto everyone else youre part of the problem
Conservative,most people cant afford checkups and routine procedures
Conservative," in a homogenous communal oriented society where it doesnt matter which side of the political spectrum you are on that wants it yes




why does homogeny and communal orientation matter i hear it as a common rebuttal here but universal healthcare would be a government service like any other"
Conservative,"eu data is different from data i was considering because eu has developing countries within it that grow at a faster rate

i mean lets be fair there are us states that are effectively on par with developing nations too after all our healthcare system is third world 

i guess the eu average works though

it does thank you for recognizing that the us is somewhat analogous to the eu 

this discussion was never about the average person lol i was explaining my financial situation and whether it would be dumb or smart for me to support such policy

i have always been talking about most people it is you who were not 

significant medical bills i work in a field that provides me with lifetime health insurance after 20 years along with a pension it wont hit me as hard as what youre thinking

thats fine youre allowed to be selfish and think of yourself over society thats your right and there isnt anything wrong with it however many of the things you said were pretty much false you should now be better informed and i hope you consider those things in the future 

our medical system doctors and nurses wages are about double that of most developed eu countries that probably contributed to being half the cost 

by the numbers higher doctor and nurse salaries account for about 25httpswwwcommonwealthfundorgpublicationsissuebriefs2023octhighushealthcarespendingwhereisitallgoing of the excess spending and its this way in part because we have about 30 fewer doctors than eu nations do on average eu nations make training healthcare workers a national priority and have policies to incentivize it we on the other hand have a literal cap on the number of people who can become doctors each yearbecause of the doctors lobby 

do you think we should pay them much less

yes we can lower the price equilibria point on the supplydemand curves by incentivizing the increase of supply of healthcare workers just like every other nation does"
Conservative,"you dont speak for me or know my cicrumcstances this is the internet tho so make the bad faith assumptions all you want clearly you arent here to learn a different perspective you just want to soap box

government isnt the answer"
Conservative,then you can give them your money and not mine thats not my problem
Conservative,"your answer is in what you quoted

also we are essentially 50 countries of varying cultures wants and needs despite what im told no not everyone wants what youre selling forcing it on them gets that much push back

do it state by state"
Conservative,"our healthcare system is not by any means third world lol i can get an mri within a week for 200 and all i have to do is call the hospital

the us isnt really comparable to the eu like you claim too many differences

yes exactly i am referring to myself because thats what my response was you turned it off topic

at the end of the day its stupid for someone to support a policy in which it would negatively affect them long term for the benefit of the minority of the country"
Conservative,i can make educated guesses and my guess is you cant afford a major procedure or even a hospital visit after an auto accident
Conservative,you should really be more interested in preventative care they can help reduce emergencies and thus costs
Conservative,"our healthcare system is not by any means third world lol i can get an mri within a week for 200 and all i have to do is call the hospital

in terms of adequate healthcare access and systemic level health outcomes yes it absolutely is by far the worst among all high income countries people in the us simply just diehttpswwwhealthsystemtrackerorgindicatorqualitymortalityamenablehealthcare at much higher rates because they simply do not or can not get treatment for treatable things 

the us isnt really comparable to the eu like you claim too many differences

oh my what a convincing argument you have made so many sources so many quantitative statistics yes your opinion is truly unimpeachable and formed via objective analysis instead of following your belief system totally totes 

yes exactly i am referring to myself because thats what my response was you turned it off topic

nope you responded my comment about his plan being better for most youre the one who made it individual 

at the end of the day its stupid for someone to support a policy in which it would negatively affect them long term for the benefit of the minority of the country

yes it would be fortunately it was a plan that wouldve helped the vast majority of the country 

its unfortunate that you refuse to even look at the data that shows that you have been completely unable to bring a single citation to the table you do not have opinions grounded in facts they are opinions ground in your belief system"
Conservative,doesnt mean youre right
Conservative,who said im not and dont do said things i said someone elses problems arent my problems and dont want tax payers to fund them voluntarily all for it
Conservative,"worst because of the low quality healthcare about 20 of americans have

it wouldnt have helped the vast majority of the country about 70 of the nation would see no benefit or actually see worse outcomes from government insurance"
Conservative,im not trying to be right im telling you about real world problems whether they occur to you personally or not it isnt only about you
Conservative,someone else is funding your private healthcare as well so you should care about others
Conservative,"go ahead and back up your assertions with data 

ill wait"
Conservative,sure it is about me i care about me and my family before yours i dont put your by that i mean anyone else needs above mine
Conservative,i do care about others jsut dont force me to care
Conservative,"just common sense when looking at policy rates and average incomes if people pay more for worse or equal care its a bad plan

best case scenario its equal for the majority of people

if our healthcare was really third world would we have such large amounts of healthcare infrastructure
not to mention most of the poor health outcomes can be more associated with poor health choices more common in this country than any european nation americans love calorie dense foods

your claim that our healthcare is 3rd world isnt suggested by any data 

httpswwwncbinlmnihgovpmcarticlespmc10317843"
Conservative,thats fine but youll still need healthcare and youll still need help with those costs
Conservative,if youre paying for insurance whether its private or government funded then you do care because thats how all insurance works
Conservative,"worst because of the low quality healthcare about 20 of americans have

it wouldnt have helped the vast majority of the country about 70 of the nation would see no benefit or actually see worse outcomes from government insurance

you didnt back up your two specific claims above with data at all 

just common sense when looking at policy rates and average incomes if people pay more for worse or equal care its a bad plan

you cited no data and my data says youre wrong i already did the math and gave citations above 

if our healthcare was really third world would we have such large amounts of healthcare infrastructure not to mention most of the poor health outcomes can be more associated with poor health choices more common in this country than any european nation americans love calorie dense foods

uh huh your feelings are not valid here bring data i already showed that americans die from treatable things more then all of our peer countries 

your claim that our healthcare is 3rd world isnt suggested by any data

lol you clearly didnt even read it

unfortunately instead of seeing a significant return on this investment the nation lags significantly behind most of the developed world in a wide range of health outcomes among the 38 members of the intergovernmental agency organization for economic cooperation and development oecd the united states is ranked 34th in infant mortality 32nd in total life expectancy 32nd in suicide rates and 38th in total obesity rates 18 

additionally approximately 8 of americans are not covered by any form of health insurance 10 for these patients as well as the underinsured the anticipated outofpocket costs associated with medical treatment can have a profound effect a recent poll of a representative sample of americans with and without insurance found that 41 of respondents reported forgoing a necessary visit to their local emergency department in the past year due to concerns about cost 20 an additional 26 reported delaying or skipping treatment and 19 reported postponing the purchase of their medications due to cost around 12 of americans required borrowing money to pay for their medical care

in terms of healthcare access and actual overall healthcare outcomes we are at the bottom of the first world there are actual third world countries that do better"
Conservative," but youll still need healthcare

currently no i dont i will if i get in a car wreck or something which is what insurance is suppsoed to cover not a physical or blood work"
Conservative,right and my insurance doesnt cover bloodwork to check my cholesterol it covers if i break my leg as it should
Conservative,let me ask you what is the most common disease people die from in the us
Conservative,good luck getting your insurer to pay for something after the fact your premiums will be through the roof too because of that tactic theyre smarter than you
Conservative,all insurers cover routine bloodwork
Conservative,"takes out binoculars and looks around 

yep no data to be seen here just beliefs"
Conservative,"youre right because there isnt data to support your statement saying everyone will have equal or better healthcare even if it comes at much more expensive prices

unless you sit there and compare the us healthcare industry to countries which are not comparable in any way other than the term healthcare meaning the same thing lol

as i said before not only will i be paying more for worse healthcare as i get older i will be paying substantially more money than i would if i had my own private plan 

there is data out there to suggest a large volume of older physicians will immediately seek retirement if their pay is decreased even though we are already short like tens of thousands

there is no evidence to suggest i personally will receive better or equal care compared to what i already have my plan is cheaper and more affordable than any european alternative cheapest being 2x more expensive even if i invested that difference i would have hundreds of thousands more dollars to pay for retirement care needs

this doesnt just go for me this goes for a lot of people if that wasnt the case why do you think so many people dont support or dont want a government run plan"
Conservative,"wow still not one single citation of data not one 

youre right because there isnt data to support your statement saying everyone will have equal or better healthcare

yes there is i showed it 

unless you sit there and compare the us healthcare industry to countries which are not comparable in any way other than the term healthcare meaning the same thing lol

feelings ones that are objectively false citations above 

as i said before not only will i be paying more for worse healthcare as i get older i will be paying substantially more money than i would if i had my own private plan

not in terms of total comp you wont you dont seem to understand that concept though 

there is data out there to suggest a large volume of older physicians will immediately seek retirement if their pay is decreased even though we are already short like tens of thousands

uh huh show me to data 

 my plan is cheaper and more affordable than any european alternative cheapest being 2x more expensive 

lol no its not if youre accounting for actual net compensation like i said you dont seem to understand that concept 

even if i invested that difference i would have hundreds of thousands more dollars to pay for retirement care needs

go ahead show me the math i dare you 

this doesnt just go for me this goes for a lot of people if that wasnt the case why do you think so many people dont support or dont want a government run plan

because like you they dont understand how terrible our system actually is"
Conservative,"youre stubborn as a rock lol 

total compensation are you adding in my employers compensation which under us proposals would be taxes anyway under the plan even you said earlier my plan is cheaper however because its less than the average it doesnt matter to you

or because they dont like the idea of the government and understand how inefficient and expensive government programs are

how do you account for geographical and healthcare accessibility differences between the us and eu

eu countries have sales taxes income taxes at federal and state levels and other taxes in order to pay for healthcare but supposedly we can do it by just taxing companies and the wealthy lol not to mention corporate tax is just an inadvertent sales tax

us has a much higher percentage of private hospitals which thrive off of high costs but also investments how do you deal with private hospitals losing investor support if their income is restricted

people in the us are not as consistent with preventative care which is usually why our system focuses more on specialized treatment how do you change cultural differences that have created mistrust both within the government and healthcare to prevent this and stop high cost long term expenses to taxpayers who need to access the care as well since there is limited funding"
Conservative,"lol still not one single scrap of data all talking points and feelings backed up by nothing whatsoever 

youre stubborn as a rock lol

actually understanding the issue and how its a drag on our entire country will do that its because im a patriot 

total compensation are you adding in my employers compensation which under us proposals would be taxes anyway under the plan

correct under bernies plan which i dont really support most employers would save money either immediately or over time as cost negotiations take effect for example medicare was allowed limited ability to negotiate prices for certain drugs for the first time ever and it achieved an average reduction of prices on 63httpswwwwhitehousegovbriefingroomstatementsreleases20240815factsheetbidenharrisadministrationannouncesnewlowerpricesforfirsttendrugsselectedformedicarepricenegotiationtolowercostsformillionsofamericans employees should then capture some of that savings wedge since it would be easier for them to change jobs and competition exists for their labor thats market forces working 

even you said earlier my plan is cheaper however because its less than the average it doesnt matter to you

yes its cheap for you because your union negotiated it but its the same price in total comp for employers total comp matters its a free market employees can capture some of that savings wedge that would result from uhc because there is competition for employees yay capitalism why do you think your presumably federalstatelocal government job pays so little in salary vs private its because they make up the total comp on bonkers level benefits 

or because they dont like the idea of the government and understand how inefficient and expensive government programs are

thats a dogmatic belief by you not born out by the evidence 

literally every government run healthcare program around the first world does it both better and cheaper 

literally every single one by alot 

but sure america is special in a bad way it cant do what everyone else because we suck lol thats what youre saying 

i dont care if you dont like the idea by the example of many countries its a massive loss for the american people to not have uhc its literally a comparative loss of over a trillion dollars to not have uhc 

 how do you account for geographical and healthcare accessibility differences between the us and eu

well first youd need to actually define what youre saying instead of repeating a vague talking point  but ill assume youre talking about rural hospital viability 

we already subsidize rural hospitals in the us few rural hospitals can survive in the free market because people in rural areas do not have the population density or the populace simply can not afford to pay for healthcare at current actual market levels 

the government literally supports rural hospitals now with subsidies it would be no different under a uhc better even since everyone would have ability to pay 

eu countries have sales taxes income taxes at federal and state levels and other taxes in order to pay for healthcare but supposedly we can do it by just taxing companies and the wealthy lol not to mention corporate tax is just an inadvertent sales tax

yea because we already pay about 7000 in taxes for healthcare before we pay another 6k privately we literally already pay more in taxes for healthcare than the the comparable country that pays if 6651httpswwwhealthsystemtrackerorgchartcollectionhealthspendinguscomparecountriesgdp20per20capita20and20health20consumption20spending20per20capita20202220us20dollars20ppp20adjusted

us has a much higher percentage of private hospitals which thrive off of high costs but also investments how do you deal with private hospitals losing investor support if their income is restricted

lol the us has almost half the hospital beds of the euhttpsdataworldbankorgindicatorshmedbedszsend2017locationsusoeeustart2017viewbar 29 us vs 54 eu per 1000 

people in the us are not as consistent with preventative care 

yes because 

1 we have fewer doctors per capita than comparable nations about 30 less citation above 

2 we are 2nd worsthttpswwwoecdilibraryorgsites242e3c8cen132indexhtmlitemidcontentpublication242e3c8cencspe90031be7ce6b03025f09a0c506286b0itemigooecditemcontenttypebooksectiond1e316 in wait times for primary care vs comparable nations 

3 43 of people are under insuredhttpswwwforbescomsitesjoshuacohen20240101ushealthcaresystemleavesfartoomanypeopleunderinsured its therefore too expensive for many people 


which is usually why our system focuses more on specialized treatment 

uh yea thats why it costs so much specialty care and heroic care costs vastly more than primary and preventative care 

how do you change cultural differences that have created mistrust both within the government and healthcare to prevent this and stop high cost long term expenses to taxpayers who need to access the care as well since there is limited funding

provide high quality care at reasonable costs then people will start using it more regularly it literally worked everywhere else"
Conservative,thanks for not answering any of my questions shows the lack of adaptability of our system if you cant justify it
Conservative,"are you just choosing to lie now 

how unsurprising"
Conservative,choosing to lie you simply didnt address questions you couldnt answer lol
Conservative,"yet again thats a lie 

unsurprising"
Conservative,sure just continue to brush it off homie
Conservative,go ahead and be specific mr liar
Conservative,says the one who refuses to answer questions
Conservative,removed
Conservative,lame i asked and you still cant tell me what youre referring to
Conservative,"warning treat other users with civility and respect 

personal attacks and stereotyping are not allowed"
Conservative,i asked you questions and you still cant answer
Conservative,"alright bud i asked twice and you havent told me what 

have a good day"
Conservative,i asked 4 times now wishing you well
Liberal,"the only reason it wouldnt is the same reason the nhs has issues  conservatives would do everything in their power to undermine sabotage defund defame and otherwise ruin it with every election

thats itjust like most other things"
Liberal,it could honestly we could pick almost any system that another country uses and roll with it making all insurance companies nonprofits a public option or medicare for all minus the ban on all private insurance would all work great
Liberal,because half the country is determined to make it not work it absolutely could if it werent for that i think the best way is to slowly work our way in to it make medicare something you can buy in to as it gets bigger it gets more powerful and better for the consumer then more people or companies want to buy in and the cycle continues these federal programs are already there they just only serve the oldest and poorest in our society very inconveniently the most expensive people in a society could we just force it sure but politicians will fight it and without really understanding it their constituents will back them
Liberal,"universalsingle payer

single payer is too expensive and giving republicans control over all healthcare is a terrible idea literally will kill abortion without directly overturning anything

you can get universal without single payer"
Liberal,"as an australian who has always lived with universal healthcare i can see a few reasons why it might not work in the us

1 the us insurance industry

the us has a massive insurance industry which employs a lot of people and which has attracted massive investment it represents a bit over 5 of the us economy we are seeing a downturn in private health insurance in australia but the drop in the industry in the us if a universal healthcare model became available would be earthshaking to the economy short term obviously long term the effects would be positive as the burden of disease on the economy was relieved and more people were able to participate in the workforce but that would take a while to kick in

2  built up demand

given that a significant number of people have not been able to afford the care they need it is reasonable to expect a huge demand for services in the early days there would be significant wait times to see specialists and people would still continue to die with untreated disease

3 poorly educated americans incapable of critical thought

opportunistic politicians would claim that the system doesnt work when it had impacts on the share market and when huge numbers of people came forward with untreated chronic disease and couldnt all immediately be treated segments of the media owned by billionaires would promote this narrative and it appears a huge chunk of americans would be so incapable of understanding what is very clearly in their best interest and would instead buy the bullshit that everything was better when billionaires paid less tax and getting sick meant loosing your job home and life"
Liberal,im a huge proponent of universal healthcare the largest downside is that so so so many jobs will become obsolete if it goes into effect those who work in the insurance industry benefits managers at companies financial departments at hospitals and doctors office and thats the tip of the ice burg
Liberal,their isnt any reason it wont work their are just a lot of people who says it cant work many of them paid to say so
Liberal,"its not that i dont think it wouldnt work its that i dont think most people want the bureaucracy and taxation required to run the thing and if it was implemented federally it would be easily overthrown

places like france get a single entity because theres universal consensus that its good and theyre willing to pay for it its not the rich paying for it everyone is chipping in at least something they have high sugar tax the danish tax fat content other countries have the highest alcohol and tobacco taxes in the world france funds their program in part through taxing casinos england banned advertising towards children japan taxes you for being too fat all countries have limits on sugar and fat content as well as stricter chemical and farming regulations they all incentivise healthy living through fitness programs at a young age weve seen not only the negative reactions to making school lunches healthy under obama but the negative reaction in the very liberal nyc towards banning the largest sizes of sodas americans flat out will not put up with such a system

we also need a way to prevent it just being a daycare for voluntarily unhealthy people if youre unhealthy in any way and obesity is unhealthy in the private insurance market its reflected not only in the lower quality of life but in your insurance premiums as well but if youre unhealthy in any kind of public system you are a direct burden on society and society as represented by the government takes a direct interest in making you not one i doubt americans which hold individual liberty at their core would put up with such a system 

beyond that implementing it federally makes it too big of a target because there isnt consensus implementing it in blue states like california to show everyone how great it is or in the worst case scenario how not to go about it will both make it harder to tear down and actually use the american model of government to its peak advantage in trying out several different things at once to see what works best in what scenarios its more similar to nhs scotland rather than the nhs in this way

so heres the steps to get it

1 be honest and make real proposals for the funding structure and benefits ive only ever seen cortez and sanders advocate for it and say how great it would be i havent seen any legislation that they would put on the table presenting a solid plan lets people honestly confront what would be expected of them what would be expected of society at large and what the benefits would be will let them decide if it really is something they want

2 implement varying structures at the state level this protects it against people hostile to the idea and gives us room to experiment more

3 if that doesnt go up in flames then support naturally rises nationally and we can mandate that states implement similar systems at home a la scotland or canada a single federal system would be too bulky and unresponsive imo"
Liberal,"i think the premise of your question is flawed i dont think there are many if any liberals who think universal healthcare wouldnt work in the us in fact believing universal healthcare would work is kind of a defining feature of being an american liberal

ill echo what others here have pointed out the only reason universal healthcare wouldnt work is the conservatives would undermine and sabotage it as much as possible its what they do with government in general they claim government doesnt work then they go about diligently breaking it to prove their point"
Liberal,because of the saboteurs who dont want it to
Liberal,because a sizeable portion of the populace has eaten the propaganda and think that  socialized medicine   is antithetical to capitalism  well in some says it is  and unamerican they think that america is and therefore must be the best at everything so all the other developed countries must have horrific healthcare systems stories of canadians waiting hours for lifesaving surgery  etc seem to be the goto  im canadian so im honestly tird of hearing this shit or other countries social health systems being poor at fostering  innovation   ie the profit motive is the only reason and thus the only way  we have vaccines and life saving medicine they ignore the fact that pharmaceuticals cost like 110th the cost in canada and other developed countries than they do in america  and rehash anecdotes about long wait times  in canada it is based on need so if youre literally having a heart attack or have a hole in your spleen you are wheeled right into surgery  its even harder to undo this when you have essentially a right wing party thats against any and all forms of universal healthcarebut then you have an opposition party that is in favor or a milktoast  public option  or are also beholden to insurance companies and buy the whole  free market  schtick just as much as the right
Liberal,because the republicans wouldnt want it to work
Liberal,because half of the country consists of selfish assholes
Liberal,"no reason

now question for you and others whove asked questions like this

how is it possible to get far enough into politics and policy that you decide to take what is essentially a fringe ideology from the left  not criticizing socialism but just saying its certainly not a default ideology in the us  and not have any clue that liberals would want universal healthcare"
Liberal,removed
Liberal,"the us would operate very well with a decentralised healthcare system federal money or federal mandates that make states construct a healthcare state

the disadvantage of that is that republican states would either mismanage their healthcare system on purpose in an attempt to say universal healthcare doesnt work republican states may also just refuse to fund their welfare system because giving people a good quality of life is tyrannical"
Liberal,"no one wants it for example if we wanted to have universal health care why not start at the state level last i knew ca was the 5th largest economy in the world why cant they do it or ny show everyone that it can work 


so i dont think that democrats really want it either we live in a society where we think that go fund me is the best way to pay for healthcare"
Liberal,"i doubt it actually couldnt work because it has to some extent worked in smaller and larger countries more populous and less populous countries poorer and richer countries and more diverse and less diverse countries it just depends on what you and every other american mean by work it would likely reduce the costs of healthcare but it would also make it more bureaucratic it would give the people more peace of mind but wait times might increase i think in the end it is up to the people to elect legislators that have the same common goal and most importantly to make sure it is done right i live in mexico where we have both a system of federal governmentrun hospitals and a traditional network of private healthcare providers i personally would never touch public hospitals with a 10 foot pole because in mexico theyre kinda eww but i think it is a good thing that they exist to provide care to those who cant pay for a private hospital 

x200b

the problem i see with implementing universal healthcare is that the us lacks the federalist will so to speak to create massive infrastructure and potentially tamper with state laws in order to establish a federally run system and any state who attempts to establish their own system of government run hospitals would get overrun by poor and unhealthy people thus collapsing the newly created system on the other hand the idea of abolishing private insurance and moving to medicare for all is a huge overstep because i believe people who have more money should indeed have the right to fancier not better necessarily standards of medical care"
Liberal,good luck dismantling a 100s of billions per year insurance racketthey will buy every politician to ensure it never happens
Liberal,"universal healthcare system or a single payer system

these two are not equivalent

universal health care is a broad vision and single payer is a specific policy proposal for bringing it about single payer is not the only way to achieve universal health care in fact its not even the usual way to do so

im skeptical of whether single payer is an optimal method in the us for a variety of reasons federalism diverse population with diverse health needs and demands populace that is generally promarket and values choice but universal health care is one of the main things that binds everyone left of center in this country and quite a few centerright folks as well many countries with universal health care use a multipayer system germany for example where public and private options coexist"
Liberal,"i think a hybrid model would work for example those that cant afford private plans automatically are covered by government itll be slower and lesser quality but the key thing is being bankrupted because of a medical emergency or operation wont exist anymore i believe the choice should still be there though if someone is wealthy enough and prefers their own plandoctor let them have it vs forcing everyone into one system during tax season theyd have to write that off though taxes will inevitably go up under a universal umbrella coverage

healthcare is one of the things im more left on and sets me apart from other conservatives our current system is definitely broken"
Liberal,it could obviously work its just a question of the politics
Liberal,the root problem of american healthcare is its exceptionally high cost which is compounded by decades of private health insurances profit motive mentality which results in increased costs despite competition from private companies due to healthcares extreme inelastic price which is high regardless of demand and number of competitors and the american governments constant subsidy of it if we do implement some version of a governmentrun system like the uk or canada we still wont get rid of its extremely high costs
Liberal,"this question is directed to liberals who dont think a universal healthcare system or a single payer system could work in the united states

those dont exist"
Liberal,"because old white people cannot handle seeing a minority benefit from the government

time and again ive heard old white people say theyd support universal healthcare in theory but are concerned that a minority group might benefit granted they do some pretty artful coding for minorities like illegals or undeserving

and whenever we point out some country that has a successful universal health care program the inevitable old white person retort is that its different because theyre not as diverse as we are"
Liberal,because there are tons of middle class americans with decent healthcare satisfaction in personal healthcare prices was at a high recently iirc and they will make you suffer at the ballot box if you replace their plan with a government one especially since theyll have several years of fearing the switch before it ever takes effect
Liberal,american culture would weaponize it we are a cruel and uncaring people
Liberal,"depends on your definition of work it will work just as well as anything else in the government the people who complain it wont work are also the same people who complain congress doesnt work it is more of a it wont work up to a specific standard than it wont work period

also the healthcare portion will be fine the concerns are mainly centered around the finance portion anyone who is sick will get treated in the vast majority of emergency rooms across the country it is just a matter of who pays for the treatment"
Liberal,are you confusing liberals with democrats democrats are nothing more than temporal placeholders for the republican policymakers who end up having the real power and authority in the end we have no leftwing in the us so long as the only opposition to the far right is in taking a moderate centrist stance to continue meeting conservatives halfway to what they want the modern democrat and the regan republican are practically indistinguishable from each other the democratic party has shifted so far right to work with literal fascists who will be back in full authoritarian charge next election and will make no effort trying to hide every corrupt way they will abuse their powers as there is no other party to hold them accountable for their offenses and a full half nation of dullards to go fanatic over how corporations and billionaires have every right to make more money off their illnesses and clamor for more bullet wounds and tax cuts
Liberal,government corruption and incompetence aside from that it should be fine on paper then again so should properly regulated private healthcare but our system as it stands is the worst of both worlds
Liberal,"obviously it could work  the problem is that the sanders type proposals underestimate the difficulty  right now the usa has 3 major healthcare systems  

 medicaid  provides a low quality of care at slightly over cost
 medicare  provides a higher quality of care at well below cost  helps absorb unused unit costs and exists because the usa maintains a surplus of providers most of the time  
 insurance  provides various levels of care at above unit costs 

medicare at its current price structure only works because insurance exists the united states has substantially higher costs of providing care than other countries  the reasons are

 the medical educational system is not nearly as subsidized the costs are born by students   wages for healthcare providers are much higher in the usa than elsewhere

 the usa has small medical practices run in an entrepreneurial fashion though these are getting absorbed

 the usa has higher drug costs in exchange for getting most of the global pharmaceutical    profits 

 americans are used to a very high level of choice about their medical care and not allowing for best practices to be broadly applied

 americans have a less healthy lifestyle but desire a life expectancy similar to europeans 
  americans work longer hours under more stressful conditions than europeans 
  the american diet is often worse  we might have to change our food system all the way to our agricultural system to fix this or endure much higher costs 

to have single payer work at reasonable cost almost all that has to change  changing the reimbursement system alone wouldnt solve the problem worse changing the reimbursement system to something like medicare while eliminating private insurance would bankrupt the health system 

something like the british system with medicaid for all and private insurance for many would work pretty well in the usa  were that the proposal id be a lot more interested  the proposals right now come from people who demonize insurance companies and whose math doesnt come close to adding up 

id also say we had this debate prior to and during the obama administration the democrats took an enormous political hit to build the new system  the time to do single payer was then  there werent the votes  i dont want to pay that political cost again  convince the american people first and get 70 support around a real plan then pass it 

 i find it odd that a nation that celebrates its exceptional character suddenly becomes very weak at looking after its own citizens

one of the things that america celebrates is it is not a collective society  the government doesnt look after its citizens  it provides some essential services  americans really do not want"
Liberal,"the main reason it couldnt work today at this moment us because we dont have enough medical professionals it will take years to train enough doctors and nurses to have enough capacity for universal healthcare

no issues other than political will after that"
Liberal," hundreds of thousands to millions of workers would become unemployed youll killing an entire industry

 youd have to raise taxes significantly on much of the population including higher earners not happening

doctors nurses etc make alot more money here than in other countries theyd have to take pay cuts id imagine again not happening

 we would need really down on illegal immigration 15 million illegals in the country and many of them would be using up resources that the citizens would be paying forthis is a deal breaker to the electorate"
Liberal,"disclaimer i am completely for universal healthcare and absolutely want to see it in the us 

why it wont work 
  greed current doctorsinsurance companies operate a racket and they have complete control over a human need there is no incentive to change this 
  distance there are a lot of ground to cover in the usa and to adequately cover it you would have to find a system to bridge the gaps  either a new medical transportation system that is publicly funded or more healthcare centers in sparsely populated areas this inevitably will lead to higher costs than other universal healthcare systems where people can literally just walk out their front door and down the block to a doctor
  republicans there is an entire propaganda network controlling 4852 of the population to tell them how bad and how expensive this is and how death panels will be the new norm to eliminate grandma when she gets too expensive 
  people who dont see a country that curates and maintains healthy educated workforce as an attractive incentive for top talent in every industry"
Liberal,we are just too stupid
Liberal,"because the united states fails to take border control seriously

offering a social safety net is fine but no country in the world has infinite resources all existing universal healthcare systems struggle with limitations thats part of why covid is such a big deal  high case count pushing those systems far beyond their limitations

as long as people are entering the country illegally and unaccounted for at the rate they currently are it will be impossible to properly fund a universal healthcare system the official us population is 331 million but half a million illegal border crossings are estimated to occur every year

either those people are going to avoid accessing public services because theyre afraid of being deported which is obviously bad for their health and wellbeing or they are going to access public services which takes time and resources away from the american citizens who ultimately pay for everything"
Liberal,we all think it can work  republicans are the ones who claim it cant
Liberal,oops
Liberal,"americans already have universal healthcare but its limited to those over 65 its perfectly possible for medicare to be redesigned to cover core healthcare for all people and allowing medicare to fix prices for procedures and use its largess to properly negotiate drug prices fica taxes will need to increase greatly as insurance premiums normally billed to companies and individuals decrease in total it will be a net decrease in the costs of healthcare

the problem is that almost 20 of the us economy is healthcarerelated mostly because of needless waste eg when hospitals hire four administrators for every hospital bed just to take care of the insurance paperwork this inefficiency is because healthcare companies naturally seek to overcharge and insurance companies naturally seek to minimize payouts so the conflict in interest makes billing needlessly complicated and fractious  a single payer will streamline the complexities and therefore all these excess people working in healthcare bureaucracy will need to be made redundant and that will cause a shock to unemployment and the economy a lot of insurance companies will need to restructure their core mission to focus on the supplemental insurance market and that means taking massive cuts

so the big downside of whether this could work in the united states is mostly about the economic shock and disruption"
Liberal,"because we have a population that consists of about 40 brainwashed idiots who cant do math or read apparently unless theyre reading an unhinged screed

also the way our government works means that instituting sweeping reforms means combating thoroughly entrenched unbelievably wellfunded interests to get a nearly unthinkable number of very selfish representatives on board stopping that from ever happening involves buying like two people and cheaply our system has basically become designed to not function at all the vast majority of the time

it could work just fine putting it in place is functionally impossible"
Liberal,it would
Liberal,until hospital admins and insurance profiteers and all who profit most from the current system are pressured and exposed they those profiting most will not allow these changes  they have to be exposed and publicly pressured first otherwise they will continue to have the silent upperhand in the background politics
Liberal,"it absolutely could the only problem is the currently prevailing american mindset theres no reason at all that it cant work here and in fact many reasons why it would work very well many other nations prove that fact so theres no economic argument to be had about it thats worth anyones time and energy naysayers are just plain wrong and most of them know it

the system here exists only because it enriches a small and especially evil class of people who profit from the inevitable suffering of others centuries or millennia from now the forprofit healthcare capitalists of the modernday us will be appropriately regarded as some of the meanest most selfish and most viciously coldhearted people in the history of the world and those who defended them as among the most shameless or foolish or both"
Liberal,i had a friend one time who was all upset about universal health care and i asked why she says its going to wipe out all the insurance companies i was like so do you work at one are any of your family members somehow tied to the insurance industry she had no answer people dont think
Liberal,my worry is that every federal election would be about what to change about it  about removing covering certain things vs not removing them   and about whether or not to tax junk food and what counts as junk food      i am not against it but i see that as a problem
Liberal,"i think it will happen eventually but it will be done in the most corporate welfare way possible it wont be medicare for all it will be medicaid for all

the medicaid expansion created by the affordable care act is likely the most feasible path to universal health care imo the way that works is the government buys you a health insurance plan from a provider like blue cross or united health care that covers your care at a 2 copay as the economic conditions in this country become more insufferable over time i think a scheme like this is inevitable"
Liberal,"its not free healthcare

httpsiredditp92bpzqaa5181png"
Liberal,"it could actually but there are entire industries built around providing or denying health care

medical billing is actually a sought after skill as no twi insurance companies that i am aware of use the same system or have the same requirements beyond a specific code number for a given procedure"
Liberal,interesting question i dont know any liberals who arent for universal healthcare at this point unless we are talking classical liberals aka conservatives who get off on telling progressives that they are technically liberals if you use an older definition that lot of people dont even know about anymore oh well
Liberal,"the main hurdle is the system that is already in place health insurance is such a massive part of the economy that switching to a completely public system overnight would be insanely disruptive 

if we are going to move in a public direction it needs to be done incrementally over many years and because of the way our political system works that isnt feasible because any gains made in that direction like obamas proposed public option would be rolled back by the next presidentcongress

tldr implementation"
Liberal,"we could and should have universal coverage in the us but that doesnt necessarily mean adopting a single payer medicare for all government run system

there is absolutely nothing wrong with these tax payer funded kinds of healthcare systems many countries like the uk  canada use government run healthcare systems to efficiently provide their citizens with high quality medical care 

unfortunately decades worth of cold war propaganda has made a significant portion of americans distrust government run social programs this makes instituting such a system exceedingly difficult 

however that does not mean that we cannot still have universal coverage if i were to design such a system for the us i would make it a hybrid of public and private medical coverage it would be based on the bismarck model of private insurance which is the system  currently used by germany france  japan

the bismarck model works by requiring all insurers and all medical providers to collectively bargain annually to set the rates for all medical services so patients and insurers would know in advance how much they could expect to pay for a broken bone surgery or prescription drug refills

then anytime a licensed medical provider sends an insurer a bill for one of their subscribers the insurer has to automatically pay it no provider networks no prior authorizations no 

a government agency could oversee medical providers to help prevent fraudulent billing but insurers could not deny legitimate claims to increase their profits

ideally we would include a robust public option for people to buy into medicaremedicaid this would act as a pace car for private insurers to compete against for subscribers if they dont ohhgy no one"
Liberal,"the public has been told by corporate media that universal healthcare will not work  yes switching to universal healthcare would be a significant financial blow to the advertising revenue stream of corporate media   additionally even on the left side of the aisle many of those in positions of power receive significant financial backing from those individuals and corporations whose fortunes would be adversely affected    


there are those who try to push the silly argument that the usa is too diverse for a one size fits all approach  this ignores the fact that corporations like home depot amazon mcdonalds ford and so on have made a fortune applying a one size fits all approach to the usa    a heart attack in boise idaho is not any different from a heart attack in miami florida"
Liberal,you could but it would more expensive than on other countries due to americas high violent crime rate high traffic accident rates and high drug abuse rate
Liberal,it could be like scotlands where the nhs is decentralised into multiple healthboards that are around the size of a county
Liberal,this was exactly what i was going to say if most people could come to an agreement to actually try and maintain universal healthcare it could work however politicians seem to spend a lot of time sabotaging policies from the other side that they dont agree with and implementing a system as large as universal healthcare while 12 of politicians want to dispose of it will lead to some consequences
Liberal,"i just plain wouldnt want it like my father in law  lives in a country with a socialized system and hes been getting 1980s quality healthcare now its at the point he could die so were figuring out how much cash we need to raise so he can go get the cutting edge therapy at cleveland clinic

anybody who doesnt address these very serious downsides of a socialized system is being dishonest and it has nothing to do with the opposition party imo

edit my fil has a somewhat rare but still well understood cardiac condition"
Liberal,"the us already has government medical systems medicare medicaid indian health service va and i imagine more im unaware of  im under medicare and va  ive been under the system in australia  
so do we take care of our people like other civilized countries do or continue to use the american system for profit instead of health care"
Liberal,do you personally know anyone on medicare and see what it takes to get something done
Liberal,less than half probably more like a quarter but the system is designed so that the tyranny of the minority continues and the majority refuse to do anything about it
Liberal,from the biased perspective of seeing up close even before the pandemic some of the thousands of people who die every year as a result of rationing their medication or avoiding primary preventative healthcare because of expensive medications or deducpi less or copays i understand that our representatives have to work along side conservativ representatives who represent their conservative constituents that have not been convinced yet that universal healthcaresingle payermedicare for all is a better system and because of this i am more of an activist who is constantly trying to convince conservatives of the benefits of medicare for all rather than taking a passive position of wait and see just because i make a good wage and can afford this massively expensive and wasteful private healthcare and insurance system
Liberal,deleted
Liberal,"because half the country is determined to make it not work

the people already covered through their employers correct"
Liberal,i see what you mean about sp so do you thing universal healthcare would work
Liberal,plenty of single payer systems are affordable by international comparitive standards
Liberal,single payer is probably the cheapest way to do it between admin overhead cut down larger risk pooling allowance for private care etc youre other argument is kind of silly because the conclusion of it is well we shouldnt have any public programs because republicans will eventually control it specifically on the abortion point private insurances do this now so it isnt some new problem
Liberal,"too expensive are you fucking kidding me  usa spends 11000 per person on healthcare every year which is the most of any country and thats for one of the worst healthcare systems in the developed world ranked 37link below the next highest spender is switzerlandranked 20th where i live now which spends just over half half of that around 7000 switzerland is not a single payeruniversal system i have health insurancesame system as america but with one small difference no corruption or greed insurance company is forced to pay for any treatment a doctor orders there is no wondering if it will be covered and they are only allowed to make so much profit per year and after that they need to make premiums cheaper the next year can only raise premiums if they run a loss the year before hospitals are all run by the statenot the federal government doctors can work either private or for the state  

the entire top 19 except oman i have no idea what system they have and dont care enough to look it up are single payer systems where everyone has the right to healthcare they all spend less than half of what the usa does now so dont give me that its too expensive bullshit your entire system now is 100 setup to make insurance companies and healthcare providers profit nothing more"
Liberal,"too expensive

in terms of what do we not have the nurses and doctors to have a single payer system similar to say canadas or the uks can we not produce enough drugs to treat people are there not enough xray machines in the united states i dont see it that way the real resources exist so we can afford to do it by any relevant use of the word certainly our ability to afford it isnt limited by the literal cost in usd since the government can spend as much usd as it wishes"
Liberal,seeing how biden is privatizing medicare via dces a strong robust universal single payer might be the only way to prevent a universal healthcare system from being cut into not being universal
Liberal,"
1 poorly educated americans incapable of critical thought

people you dont agree with"
Liberal,we could save lives and keep people healthy that would help the economy with jobs and what not
Liberal,are you in favor of it
Liberal,if any thats just absurd of course there are for every political position theres liberals and conservatives who go against the grain
Liberal,"a better question would have been dont believe a specific universal healthcare program would work 

there are many paths to universal healthcare and medicare for all is far from the only or best one"
Liberal,my question is aimed at liberals who think universal healthcare is a bad idea which is phenomenon that i have only seen in the us
Liberal,the 2020 democratic primary was full of liberal candidates running against universal healthcare if liberals are for it why is it represented in only a few fringe politicians
Liberal,"your attitude seems baffling to me 

a country with the largest military the world has ever seen lacks the imagination to conceive of a healthcare system that works for all

you guys already have socialised medicine its just extremely inefficient"
Liberal,"so as a brit and a big supporter of the nhs this is a valid concern a very recent personal experience of mine illustrates the frustrations you can have with the nhs

my dad started experiencing heart trouble earlier this year and after 9 months he had failed to get anything more substantial than a consultation with his local gp he is a very principled man who is also a big believer in the nhs so despite having the means to seek private healthcare he held on until hed become quite scared and his calls and letters had gone unanswered when he arranged for tests privately he went into cardiac arrest right there at the hospital and had to be defibrillated he was told he needed a heart bypass and possibly through the private doctors own contacts although that is slight speculation got an appointment for surgery on the nhs less than 2 weeks later he is now recovering nicely after after a pretty terrifying ordeal that went on much longer than it should

in a nutshell he had a great outcome but it really shouldnt have taken a near death experience to kick things into gear now there are extenuating circumstances what with covid consuming so much of the health services resources and in my experience this is not typical normally the nhs works great when people have serious conditions and its the more routine stuff that takes a long time

im very skeptical socialized medicine would work in the united states at the quality americans would demand

i think youre probably right in some cases though those with poor or no coverage would clearly be better off"
Liberal,do you have polling to substantiate your claim that no one wants it
Liberal,"people who have more money should indeed have the right to fancier not better necessarily standards of medical care

in counties with singlepayer systems they have different tiers of coverage so everyone gets the baseline service but if you want to pay a little extra for gold coverage thats an option too"
Liberal,"i agree its a good push 

let there be a public option to opt into if you dont then keep paying absurd deductibles and shit"
Liberal,why wont highcosts disappear
Liberal,the health insurers actually drive down healthcare costs whenever possible and drive up premiums or deny coverage thats how they make their money the ones driving up healthcare costs are pharmaceutical companies healthcare device manufacturers distribution companies and hospital administrators
Liberal,im in downvote hell but look at obamacare it was sabotaged to not work right and was proof of a failed concept look at how horrible medicare medicaid and vet assistance are
Liberal,"the distance argument is interesting to me i drove across the country recently north dakota to arizona and the country is huge 

you almost have to think about rural healthcare versus urban healthcare almost two distinct systems

i see that as a hurdle that would need to be overcome"
Liberal,"lets assume your number is correct at 12m per year  first off there are reverse crossing as well  so lets make it 14m who stay  thats about 1 of the population  to maintain population the average women has to have 21 children in her lifetime  with 331m people thats 435m births per year  how much does the extra 25m really matter  

also if illegals are working here they are paying for things as well  they contribute to our economy which gets taxed  they just get fewer benefits so the net profit to government is much higher"
Liberal,maybe she wasnt personally but almost 600 thousand do you need to answer for that much unemployment caused by the plan to remove insurance
Liberal,no one said it wasnt
Liberal,"we could and should have universal coverage in the us but that doesnt necessarily mean adopting a single payer medicare for all government run system

ideally we would include a robust public option for people to buy into medicaremedicaid this would act as a pace car for private insurers to compete against for subscribers if they dont offer competitive prices andor extra perks they would soon become obsolete then we would end up with a de facto single payer system

such a system still requires that everyone take personal responsibility for their own potential healthcare liabilities by obtaining coverage even republican senator rand paul has explained why such an individual mandate is necessary to keep private insurance solvent without discrimination against preexisting conditions

to make the individual mandate less burdensome all employers have to either provide affordable insurance benefits or pay adequate wages for their employees to purchase their own plans independently and the government can offer robust subsidies to low income workers and to small businesses who can show that such an expense would be sustainable 

personal note

i myself have expensive preexisting conditions stemming from a brain tumor i had removed in 2006 before the aca took full effect i had to pay 1203 each month until i reached a 5000 deductible for refills of a medication that i need in order to function

in the last year prior to the patient protections obamacare medical costs added up to 55 of my small income as a caregiver for people with disabilities since then i have saved 75000 over 8 years on my healthcare

i understand that there are still holes in the system that have been manipulated to hurt especially poor people in the states that have refused to accept the medicaid expansion 

the system i have outlined could be a great compromise to preserve private insurance as a realistic choice in our healthcare system while this compromise may not lead to the most efficient model of healthcare as someone who would be especially vulnerable to dramatic shifts in our healthcare i prefer a system that has buy in from all sides to avoid these catastrophic fluctuations 

yet compromise requires two good faith parties to negotiate"
Liberal,to be fair this is the case in england too
Liberal,yeah but poorer counties would depend on federalstate subsidies to keep going so republicans in congress could undercut them just as easily as they could a centralized system
Liberal,nhs scotland is funded per head compared to england thats why it appears to have better service
Liberal,just curious would typical insurance in the usa cover the therepy    is it available in most regions
Liberal,also which country we talking about here there are plenty with a socialized healthcare industry but they are not all equal in wealth and development if the us had mca it would instantly be the most well funded universal healthcare program on the planet i dont think different universal healthcare systems are comparable unless you are considering the funding behind them
Liberal,"exactly it has medical systems for the very poor old specific groups and military 

i do wish i could opt into a single payeruniversal option tho 

i currently pay about 8 of my salary if i were to hit my out of pocket max so insurance would finally pay everything

single payer would be cheaper for myself and i assume 99 of americans"
Liberal,yeah it really wouldnt be that hard to make those programs available to everyone you dont have to build a new one from the ground up
Liberal,"its kinda of crazy ive had state medicaid because i used to live in monasteries and made no money the medicaid pays for me to have the highest level care possible through kaiser the government has paid for 6 major surgeries treatment for a potentially fatal chronic illness with numerous er visits i only received that because i literally made no money but it was available for anyone making 30k which is pretty high

im hitting 6 figures this year but im still on medicaid because the state put a moratorium on removing people from medicaid for any reason during the pandemic

universal healthcare already exists in the us it is quite good and it is heavily subsidized by the federal government 99 of californians have either medicaid or private insurance and the ca budget is doing fine

universal healthcare exists but conservatives pretend its a disaster because in red states that stupidly refused federal funding its the worst healthcare available and you can basically only get it if your disabled and cant work

conservatives lets cut as much from the government as possible

also conservatives look at how bad medicaid is its a complete disaster and terrible care"
Liberal,"yes and the only things they dislike about it are having to deal with all the various supplement plans

medicare has a 75 approval rating amongst beneficiaries most of its problems come from the fact that it cannot negotiate drug prices and the headaches of some supplemental plans"
Liberal,maybe more like a quarter but about half of voters which is what counts
Liberal,"to do that youd have to allow medicare to negotiate prices for providers like the insurance companies are allowed to do thats always been something republicans have flat refused to even contemplate since they know it would end up with medicare absolutely dominating the private insurers and driving healthcare costs down 

they try to spin this as being concerned about medicare being unprofitable on the taxpayer dime but the actual risk is that medicare could cut off the tap to providers who wont negotiate on prices since medicare is gigantic their ability to negotiate lower prices for patients is immense

essentially republicans know that if medicare was allowed to operate more like an epo it would be able to drive down national healthcare costs and deliver better health outcomes for americans at much lower costs thats why theyre opposedreducing healthcare costs endangers their donors"
Liberal,they already have the largest insurance agency in the country it wouldnt be that hard to not be undercut by them they have the kind of thats just business power that other businesses would consider incredibly unfair
Liberal,not at all republicans even those paying a fortune through their employer or unable to afford it at all they will fight tooth and nail because the people they trust are telling them this is some big socialist plot
Liberal,covered
Liberal,yeah a public option without complrtely dismantling private insurance would work
Liberal,total healthcare costs would be cheaper but the amount of money spent by the federal government would increase substantially m4a as proposed by sanders would nearly double the federal budget raising those funds is a non trivial problem to solve nobody ever seems to explain a realistic way to do it
Liberal,"so first off 37 is not one of the worst there are 195 countries im not saying we should accept being 37th but dont be hypoerbolic also you said link below and never linked anything which i assume was a mistake

yes the amount individuals pay would not necessarily be higher it would also not necessarily be lower that money needs to come from somewhere we cannot as others replying suggested just create more money to pay for it thats how you get inflation crisies you know like the one right now despite claims that taxing just the 1 would cover it it wouldnt everyones taxes would need to go up to cover full single payer since we still need to pay for everything else too

i did some digging of my own and found this list httpsworldpopulationreviewcomcountryrankingsbesthealthcareintheworld

us here is 19 so it isnt the one you used but ill still go off that

you are wrong not everything in the top are single payer singapore france and germany are not and maybe more i didnt check literally every country because again universal health caresingle payer"
Liberal," since the government can spend as much usd as it wishes

thats not how economics works"
Liberal,m4a would nearly double the yearly federal budget those funds have to be raised from somewhere i havent seen any realistic tax proposals that would achieve this
Liberal,two terms which are not always mutually exclusive
Liberal,convince me im wrong
Liberal,but that will not keep at least 18 million healthcare jobs that would become obsolete sourcehttpswwwpoliticocomnewsagenda20191125medicareforalljobs067781 yes a healthy economy is a strong economy but its still a staggering amount of jobs that would be lost
Liberal,yes healthcare costs are outrageous and insurance companies are unnecessary middle men we should have a universal health care system
Liberal,"well i said many if any so way to be peter pedantry over here youre right there is a tiny almost numerically meaningless percentage of liberals who dont believe in universal healthcare congratulations that was a big victory you got in right at the 2021 buzzer 

anyway universal healthcare is such a defining feature of american liberal politics kind of like how im sure there is a tiny minority of conservatives who dont fantasize about getting  fucked by a sentient ar15 in a donald trump wig but its such a core part of being a conservative that we can go ahead and paint with broad brushes here"
Liberal,pretty much all liberals want universal healthcare now some may not want singlepayer insurance remember that a singlepayer system is just one of many models for getting to universal health care
Liberal,"literally have never met one never expect to 

joe lieberman was a selfish piece of shit joe manchin is a democrat that wins in wv and sinema is  who the fuck knows a progressivesocialist that now takes campaign money from the right and buys new dresses 

man even 2530 years ago when i had friends that identified as socialist none of them where confused about the democratic position on universal healthcare this is new"
Liberal,"sigh 

weve been fighting for universal healthcare ever since ted kennedy made easily one of the worse moves in modern politics and killed the nixon plan 

the very structure of our government and the stupid swings of fixed two year elections makes it impossible not hard but impossible to pass a straight up universal healthcare plan that would last long enough to be implemented its going to be incremental or not at all 

if bernie sanders won in 2016 or 2020 we wouldnt have a universal healthcare system of any kind"
Liberal," a country with the largest military the world has ever seen lacks the imagination to conceive of a healthcare system that works for all

the usa healthcare budget federal state and private is 45x the size of the military budget  rhetoric like that is why single payer advocates dont get taken seriously"
Liberal,removed
Liberal,thats not really arguing against what theyre saying the size of the us military has nothing to do with the us healthcare system just because the us has a large military doesnt mean a single payer system can realistically be implemented in the us
Liberal,"no one is a hyperbole


however all you have to do is look at what the states are doing and not what they say if the democrats wanted to they could enact universal healthcare in california or ny they have a vetoproof majority if it is what they wanted why havent they free healthcare can only come from the federal government reduced housing why arent they rezoning they arent because they dont want it if it was something they wanted they would do it 


so if the democrats and the republicans dont want it then it isnt going to work also the people dont have it important enough as something they would say they would vote for if it was important enough the people would have voted for bernie"
Liberal,exactly if one is wealthy enough to pay their own let them thats one of the main complaints from republicans is lack of choice
Liberal,not quite health insurance companies profit from measured increases in price over time boiled down they make a percentage of cost
Liberal,sorry let me whittle away with untreated health issues  go into bankruptcy so a few people can keep their jobs at a call center get the fuck outta here
Liberal,the point needs to be madeit is a conscious choice the attack line on univercial healthcare is that people just want something for freeits not free and neither is anything else
Liberal,is it i thought that this was something done by holyrood not westminster
Liberal,would that work in america
Liberal,"i think a website called bernie tax did the math and m4all was indeed cheaper for 90 of americans personally i loved his plan besides the fact that he wanted to completely ban private insurance

httpswwwbernietaxcom"
Liberal,im finding more and more the out of pocket max isnt even guaranteed anymore
Liberal,how do you know if it would be cheaper
Liberal,8 seems really low    out of pocket maximum is often 15000 which doesnt include premiums i think
Liberal,"medicaid is literally charity care you understand that yes

in regard to a public option theres a general understanding that people will pay less because of bargaining power but medicare and any public option would have to be selffunded medicaid is great but its other peoples money"
Liberal,"medicare already pays less than forprofit insurers  so i dont see where additional savings could come from

the rates that medicare pays today are inadequate to cover the cost of providing care"
Liberal,"if youll indulge me i have a few questions

im 37 and relatively healthy i dont smoke i rarely drink the only major health problem ive had is that i have a detached retina which ive paid out of pocket roughly 10k to fix itll probably cost another half that in future costs so like 15k i pay my cobra payment every month after quitting my job back in october still looking for another one im paying like 400 a month as a single person this doesnt strike me as a crazy amount of money if my taxes were to go up 7 for example id pay roughly 2000 more each year to receive the same or worse service why would i want to do this

i guess ive never understood the drive to kick people off their employer plans it seems that a lot of people are okay paying the extra costs if they exist in order to stay with the status quo for fear of the unknown my understanding is a universal system would eliminate this this seems like a losing strategy if you did want a universal system

secondly ive also never understood where the extra doctors are going to come from especially if part of the cost saving measures will be to limit money provided to hospitals and physicians so were going to increase the number of doctors while decreasing their pay while increasing the number of patients

finally people point to the money that insurance companies make in profit if that number is 100b that amounts to roughly 330 per person i dont see this being a huge amount of money given the cost of a physical 100 or other common procedures"
Liberal,what about the public option would make it universal
Liberal,"a universal healthcare system would be much cheaper by a lot maybe even close to halfi remember seeing figures that estimated it to be between 34trillionyear but if you look at other nations and work out the numbers it would probably be around 56trillion  as of now total healthcare expenditure is about 5 trillion and expected to be close to 7 within 56 years im going to use rough round numbers here the federal government is already spending now upwards of 2trillion towards health programs most citizens are spending what 300400500 per month just on premiums and how much per year on out of pocket costs  

the federal government is already paying almost 2 trillion now the other 9 trillion spent now is from the average american paying like what 910kyear for all their healthcare costs including premiumscopaysdeductibles and out of pocket things not covered by insurance which is what like 1520 of the median income of americans if you get rid of all that and the feds already paying 2 trillion out of that 4 trillion per year it would cost you raise taxes to cover the rest  your literally trading paying 15 average of income to paying a 
45 averaged increase in taxes which could be divided up and paid for 1000 different ways where literally every single person ends up paying less overall and actually ending up with service they can use that they are paying for"
Liberal,i imagine an additional payroll tax perhaps with a percentage that changes based on income but both the employer and employee pay into it   employers shouldnt suddenly get out of paying in
Liberal,"opps httpswwwwhointhealthinfopaper30pdf  

i said one of the worst in the developed worldnot over all"
Liberal,eehhhh
Liberal,"actually it is take the cash in your wallet where did that come from it says right on there that it comes from the federal reserve at some point in the past the government spent that money into the economy maybe it traded it for a good like gold or maybe it paid it to someone in exchange for their labor  a soldier or a bureaucrat the government then collects some of those dollars back in taxes the tax money that the government collects is destroyed technically shredded and you can actually buy shredded money from the government in the old days they would burn it however that dollar in your pocket hasnt been taxed yet otherwise it wouldnt be in your pocket so you can already see that the money in the supply or at least the base money is the difference between the money the government spends and the money it collects in taxes if the government wants us to have savings  cash in our wallet  it must spend more than it eventually collects in taxes and it must spend first

how does the government practically speaking spend as much as it wants the answer is deficit spending technically the treasury does not just create new money and deposit it in someones account instead it creates treasury notes  bonds bills etc  and sells those to the primary dealer banks the federal reserve can then exchange those bonds for newly created money so in the end the fed gets treasuries on its balance sheet while the government gets new money in its treasury account which it can spend on whatever it is spending on there is no limit to the amount of treasuries that can be issued besides the debt ceiling which is an arbitrary selfimposed constraint and widely considered to be useless at this time there is no limit to the amount of new money the fed can create to purchase treasuries to hit its target interest rate and there is no possibility that the fed might refuse to purchase treasuries we can argue over how much the government should spend and on what but under the rules of the current system the government can always spend as much as it wishes"
Liberal,couldnt the rich be taxed
Liberal,employers and employees are already spending money on health insurance care   that money would instead go into the single payer system
Liberal,the funds are raised when the government decides to spend them government is the currency monopolist it creates all the money in existence when it spends and destroys money when it taxes you certainly need taxes but not to raise funds congress simply passes a budget and if expenditures are more than revenues the treasury creates new bonds and sells them they are then purchased by the fed with newly created money we can always issue as many bonds as we want and we can always spend new money as long as there is something to buy that money with as a technical matter congress could decide to pass m4a tomorrow with no new tax increases and it would be financed just fine through deficit spending there will be consequences to this but the fact remains that the money doesnt have to be raised it is simply created
Liberal,no shit but that doesnt mean its a 11 ratio either
Liberal,your ignorant statement stands on its own
Liberal,i pointed out if any because its ridiculous to even make that statement
Liberal,the liberals i have in mind are elected politicians
Liberal,2016 had a fuck ton of them during the primary
Liberal," if bernie sanders won in 2016 or 2020 we wouldnt have a universal healthcare system of any kind

because certain democrats wouldve helped republicans block it"
Liberal,is it that large because its an accurate reflection of healthcare or is that the markup due to your system being mostly private
Liberal,"in every other instance american patriotism and culture generally would see a challenge and try to overcome it but i just find it funny that when it comes to healthcare suddenly everything is impossible for multiple reasons and the solutions wont work in america because its so large

i just dont buy it as the reason why universal healthcare couldnt work in that states whats the saying letting perfection be the enemy of good"
Liberal,so what do you say to the studies that have been done by right and left think tanks that all come to the conclusion that it would cost less than what americans currently pay for the current system
Liberal,you cant use elected representatives as a proxy for the popularity of a single issue
Liberal,let them keep their health insurance through their employers ill sign up for the public option
Liberal,freeatthepointofservice this is the type is free i want
Liberal,well it depends what you mean in england the nhs is divided up into regional trusts who manage their area decide how funding gets allocated etc
Liberal,what do you mean
Liberal,"this website was created to explain just that

httpswwwbernietaxcom

if you take the averages from other nations who have a single payer or universal system

germany has a hybrid model
the highest youll pay in germany is 360 the average is 100 a month for the public option

the private option starts at 175 if youre healthy and capped at 1500

france 

the average cost of insurance is 40 per person

uk

the average cost is 1785 per year so 148 a month

italy

services are free you pay a copay of 36 for special tests 

cost of private insurance for a family of 4 ranges from 14002200 a year 

i could keep going  but this seems a lot cheaper to me i got most of my information from internationalorg and government websites 

im over here having to pay 10k before insurance fully kicks"
Liberal,i have really good insurance for my wife and i bcbs ma 2000 deductible 4000 oopm my premium will go up in may once my son is born
Liberal,"because medicare is operating in the context of a mostly private healthcare system thats why the rates are inadequate the cost of the care in the private system is excessively high

getting the cost down does mean reducing the amount of money providers can expect to get from a procedure

a public system providing care in the context of a private system means that providers can just refuse to accept people on the public system they can either shift costs onto private patients to make up for losses treating public patients or they can only accept private patients thats a viable road when most patients are private patients

thats not so viable if everyone is a public patient

if everyone is a public patient the rate the public insurer pays becomes the defacto price of the treatment"
Liberal,"if my taxes were to go up 7 for example id pay roughly 2000 more each year to receive the same or worse service why would i want to do this

its great that youre healthy and im happy for you but the reason to go singlepayer is that you dont know how long your good luck will hold you have access to the internet so im sure youve seen the horror stories of people getting slapped with hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars in medical bills even if its not that drastic medical emergencies or diagnoses can be very expensive what if  god forbid  you get diagnosed with cancer tomorrow could you pay for treatment hopefully your good luck holds forever and you never have to deal with unexpected diagnoses or medical emergencies but if youre suddenly looking at 100000 in medical bills  not an unheard of sum in the us today  that 2000 a year tax increase might not sound so bad"
Liberal,it does get a little more expensive as a single person but if you have kids or get married it stays the same a lot more people than you think are in this situation where they would pay less there wont be more doctors the system is just more efficient the way it is now if you dont have healthcare you go to the er and they have to treat you while never getting any money out of you this puts a huge strain on the area where we actually need doctors treating people that need help the most a lot of these people can just have a nurse practitioner give them some very basic care and send them on their way i dont even think the idea is to pay doctors less it is the healthcare systems and insurance companies that get cut out as well as the pharmaceutical companies that make less every time you read an article about 500 for tylenol or 1000 for a stitch someone is making a fortune off of this and it isnt the doctors
Liberal,i was 25 perfectly healthy going to school full time and working part time as a nanny when my boss who was an icu nurse brought home a really contagious bacteria called c diff i didnt have health insurance but would be put on my parents plan in april because the aca took effect i started showing symptoms on st patricks day went to the er for mostly pain meds and fluids the doctor told me that if i had insurance he would admit me by april 5th i was rushed into emergency surgery because my colon was dying inside of me i aspirated threw up under the anesthesia putting vomit in my lungs and went septic i was on a ventilator in a drug induced coma for ten days spent five weeks in the hospital including pt and ot as i had to relearn how to walk as i had lost all of my muscle mass i also had to relearn how to urinate because after you have been catheterized for so long your bladder can become temporarily paralyzed i lost 70 lbs in those five weeks leaving the hospital at 97 lbs it jump started an autoimmune disease which would take another year to diagnose multiple surgeries to fix and a ton of side effects from the medications currently my meds are over 100k bimonthly and 87k bimonthly again 11 years ago i was healthy and thriving accidents happen literally every day that are catastrophic to those who do not have health insurance and can and do bankrupt those who do have health insurance in the current state that its in i tried to go back to work part time about 5 years ago my company offered insurance it would cost me money every month after giving my entire paycheck and it still wouldnt cover my immunosuppressants you have to see that covid will cause long term consequences on the country where a lot of people who have survived will no longer be able to work and keep those plans medicare and disability will be bankrupt from these cases as for doctors i do not know a single doctor and trust when i say i know a lot of them that are solely in the field for the money
Liberal,"your paying 400 a month thats your premium 

add in your deductible and out of pocket max you might be more than 7"
Liberal,"health insurance tied to employment is a disaster during a time like now  a pandemic that made millions unemployed guess what you lose when you lose your job your employer sponsored health insurance 

400month is absolutely astronomical and a lot of americans cannot afford that its even more when someone has a spouse andor family"
Liberal,"its wonderful that you are youngish and healthyish but next year you will be 38 and after that 39 and after that

you will need intensive health care at some point in your life everyone will unless you plan to get bitten by a vampire i guess then you just need a good casket maintenance service"
Liberal," id pay roughly 2000 more each year to receive the same or worse service why would i want to do this

the main reason is that most people are paying over 1000 per month right now  im shocked that you have a cobra plan at only 400month it must be a catastrophiconly plan because there is nothing even close to that price on any state health care exchange even at the bronze level

in california or washington for example a basic bronzelevel plan costs 1400month before subsidies for lower income folks

because many people cant afford coverage or health care for cash when they need it we end up paying thousands of dollars to clean up a mess that would have cost pennies to prevent"
Liberal,"the reason you ought to prefer it is that you wont always be young and healthy but the system we choose to enact while youre young and healthy also has to provide care when youre old or sick or cant work anymore

the system that lets you get away with in theory paying very little while youre healthy will absolutely screw you later when youre not healthy and actually have to use healthcare services by choosing to take the shortsighted approach youre just deferring costs till later and the costs of us healthcare are insane 15k to treat a retinal detachment is completely insane by international standards

what we really need to do is reduce costs not just defer them that means making structural reforms that drive the cost of healthcare down even if those reforms mean you pay a little more today it i means you pay a lot less tomorrow thats a net benefit to you 

and this isnt just about your out of pocket costs that you can shift around with different sorts of insurance and having your employer pay a portion and such but the actual cost of the care has to go down 

this is essentially impossible to do with the us private healthcare system pricing is so opaque care decisions are so irrational and demand is so inelastic that usual market forces do not function in this sector of the economy the only way to bring prices down is through collective bargaining and having the government step in to directly manipulate supply relative to our essentially fixed demand to reduce prices 

thats why we should adopt universal singlepayer healthcare it gives the government the bargaining power to drive actual costs down and gives the government sufficient structural control to reduce the cost per person without reducing the quality of health outcomes and the federal government is really the only organization large enough or positioned correctly to do this for the united states 

nobody likes hearing that though everyone likes to pretend that statistical analysis is meaningless and that their personal skill or ability gives them the means to escape the numbers but it doesnt everyone will eventually consume a lot of healthcare therefore everyone has to participate in the system that pays for it therefore that should be provided as efficiently as possible and that means singlepayer 

even if it means there are some years of your life where you might end up paying more than the absolute minimum you could in theory get away with 

tldr you should want singlepayer healthcare because the healthcare system you avoid paying into today because youre healthy is the same healthcare system that youll have to use tomorrow when youre sick"
Liberal," i guess ive never understood the drive to kick people off their employer plans 

because this makes workers beholden to their employers much more"
Liberal,deleted
Liberal,"you will want to end your employer health plan because it is extra money to pay on top of your taxes and because it is tedious to figure out each plan year exactly what you want versus what is covered

for your second question the real profit in medicine is how hospitals mark up the basic costs of care from everything like the cost of hospital food to the costs of the saline solution for ivs they split some of this with insurance sure but if you were to pick between owning a hospital network or a medium sized insurance company pick the hospital congress cares much less about their profits

also as to the workload of doctors yes there will be a fair amount of long deferred procedures that need to be done however that will at least partially offset in the long run by more patients coming in and getting regular checkups regular checkups can catch major things before they can become major surgeries doctors may end up making less money especially if education costs are paid for in the case of doctors who agree to be contracted to the new health service though that is only going to be at the high end  where they can go into private practice themselves"
Liberal,"youd want to do it to help other people in your society including yourself someday

    400 a month for cobra is pretty lowso you might be in an unusual situation"
Liberal,automatic enrollment if you dont waive it you cannot waive it without insurance and a cap on premiums based on income
Liberal,universal healthcare just means that everyone in the country has access to healthcare there are many ways of achieving that any system that would extend healthcare coverage to the 28 million americans without coverage would be universal
Liberal,"because everyone who wants it has access to it

universal means everyone is covered and the public option still leaves pitentially more comprehensive private plans or employer covered plans open for those who want that"
Liberal,"yes the total expenditures spent in the entire healthcare sector would be cheaper but the amount paid by the federal government would be significant greater and we still have to raise revenue to do that the first thing doesnt solve the second problem

right now 342 trillion is collected in tax revenue each year conservatively if you assume the system would cost 6 trillion per year youre looking at having to double tax revenue to pay for it ive just never seen a realistic plan to pay for that"
Liberal,so if we need 6 trillion just for healthcare how do we pay for it we cant just print the 4 trillion extra dollars each year
Liberal,inflation is real again everyone you can stop repeating internet talking points from four years ago the government spent like it had no limit and prices have gone up and voters are pretty mad about it
Liberal,we both understand that if you felt there was any flaw in my arguement you would be pointing it out
Liberal,okay but just checking we can delete the if any part and the comment makes perfect sense right do you know what the word pedantic means
Liberal,"electoral reality kennedy fucks up the reagan revolution happens and then the right starts a rapid decent into crazy and the only things we get are 

 chip under clinton mostly because hillary did the work after the hillary care universal healthcare attempt failed and was seen as enhancing the midterm losses
 the aca  which would have morphed into near universal healthcare but now if leiberman hadnt fucked us and that also has huge voter blowback 

but right now its manchin and sinema they wont end the filibuster and nothing like a universal healthcare system happens without that plus a few senators extra to cover the ones scared they lose reelection over a yes vote"
Liberal,like whom because all liberal politicians support universal health care like having a public option like germany
Liberal,2016 has hillary the only candidate to ever actually have a universal healthcare plan go to the floor sanders and three candidates that all dropped out before iowa and one that dropped out just after
Liberal,this here is why im increasingly convinced that history will be extremely unkind to bernie sanders hes going to be seen as deluding a section of the left with an end result of delaying the very things he advocated for
Liberal,"usa healthcare is a lot more expensive to administer than it is in other countries  that being said it would still be 3x even if usa healthcare costs were like european costs    my reply to the main post outlined some reasons for it httpswwwredditcomraskaliberalcommentsrsjyeycommenthqo7m7e

the issue is not just medical providers being private but doctors being private medical groups being private different incentives with pharma education system being private  one could do a wholescale overhaul top to bottom but m4a gets sold as not being this"
Liberal,removed
Liberal,removed
Liberal,"how about i use the fact that it doesnt exist as a reason


if the us wanted it we would have it it is that simple no reason it wouldnt work other countries use it we dont want it"
Liberal,yep another possible option allow a deduction for health care expenditures etc because a public option will require most to pay a bit more in taxes to be under it
Liberal,"and we could easily do itit is the most cost effective way to do it and would deliver better overall healthcare

that is the point i want to make the trouble is there are a whole lot of money and power who dont give a damn about all that public out comes stuff"
Liberal,theyre finding ways to charge for things that arent covered
Liberal,"i have not checked out the website does this include or exclude subsides

in france for example there is no separate tax to my knowledge its just a part of the general fund"
Liberal," getting the cost down does mean reducing the amount of money providers can expect to get from a procedure

medicare reimbursement rates dont just provide less opportunity for profit they reimburse less than the cost of rendering services

medical practices cannot survive with a population entirely or predominantly publicly insured it simply isnt possible to provide services  not just at a reasonable profit margin but at all 

there is no way for medicare to cut its reimbursement rates further as they are already subsidized by private reimbursement

rural hospitals are already closing at an alarming rate  and cutting reimbursement will only accelerate the destruction of meaningful access to healthcare"
Liberal,i guess my outlook on it is yes these things happen and they are more likely to happen as people age but between the medicare that im required to pay for and my insurance im not that concerned about it i also am a spiritual person and i believe when its our time its time so maybe that it part of it as well
Liberal,"every element of the us healthcare system is ridiculously profitable and those profits feed the high costs elsewhere

 medical schools keep the number of practicing doctors low by setting up elevated barriers to entry for new physicians in order to keep compensation up for existing doctors

  doctors often owe close to 14 million in student debt before they finally start earning big money at age 30 or 35  by losing 15 years of earning power they have to make it up during their older years  salaried doctors making 400600kyear is not unusual at all particularly specialists

  medical equipment  take an ordinary object and label it as medical equipment for big money  rentseeking lobbyists have persuaded the fda itself regulatorycaptured to put unnecessary restrictions on what can be used as medical equipment

  rentseeking has also assured you cant sue your insurance company for breach of contract if they refuse coverage for a procedure you need  insurance companies are further protected by being guaranteed a 15 profit above all other costs  find me another industry where the law guarantees a profit

  pharmaceutical companies charge us customers multiple times what they charge customers from other countries  that is because we will pay it because the law says we have to  it has nothing to do with innovation and everything to do with valuebased pricing and laws that forbid even medicare from negotiating drug prices

the best solution to all this in my opinion is to force the market to change by removing the age qualification requirement for medicare

let employers then offer supplemental plans in order to differentiate themselves  supplemental plans are awesome for the employer because their expenses are capped at medicare deductibles and copays

this will give employers room to raise wages because they are not paying north of 1000month per employee for health coverage

adding millions of people to medicare will lower medicares cost per person because our oldest and sickest people are on medicare now  by including 35yearolds who only need occasional care when they sprain an ankle we will begin to manage costs from the payer side

medicare reimbursements are already negotiated all over the country so providers will either be able to compete or they wont  lower reimbursements will force cost savings across the entire system  right down to medical school tuition

there will be things we have to do to mitigate the pain during the transition  people have set up their lives on the current system and any change we make will by definition hurt some people

one of the biggest things in my opinion is that we need to do is forgive student loan debt interest  im not in favor of forgiving the principal but i think the government needs to step in and remove interest from the equation leaving just principal and late payment fees in place

edit  i updated the medical student debt portion with my thanks to udgnick2021 for pointing out that number was wrong"
Liberal,"  every time you read an article about 500 for tylenol or 1000 for a stitch someone is making a fortune off of this and it isnt the doctors

who do you think is making a fortune off those things  pick the name of the medical group that you believe is so profitable"
Liberal,im sorry to hear your story that sounds awful
Liberal,"hate to break it to you but 400 a month per person is probably about what it costs in the us currently we spend 10k a person per year thats 833 a month per person under the current system maybe youre paying less because the premiums are subsidized by your employer and you dont need any healthcare however thats what the nation is spending as a whole one way or another for all healthcare including premiums

also most plans for this system rely on taxes paying for it so lets say they take 6 of your income for it and your employer pays another 6 if you make 20k a year you pay 100 a month in taxes and your employer does the same at 40k a year you and your employer each pay 200 a month totaling to that 400 a month figure the average wage in the us is over 50k a year so a plan like this would probably cover costs just fine and would either cost about the same in premiums or save people money and would save everyone money on treatment since thered be little to nothing for copays or drug costs"
Liberal,its not a popular response on this sub but my plan is to selfinsure along with getting additional coverage from my emplpyer
Liberal,wow is it 1400 for one person     my cobra was 1250 for one age 50 one age 18 but the copays and deductibles were fairly low      for both of us unsubsidized on aca it was 760 for fairly high deductible and copays   1400 for one person seems crazy high and i agree that 400 for one seems crazy low    this is in a far away philadelphia suburb
Liberal,he does pay in he has health insurance    its just much less expensive than i would expect
Liberal,maybe its because ive worked white collar jobs for the last 10 or so years but one health plan is very much like another in my experience
Liberal,more 7 of my salary my estimated tax hike would be 7k
Liberal,would there be an income below which the premium is zero  what about deductibles  copays
Liberal,"because everyone who wants it has access to it

so its free at the point of delivery  i dont think most versions of the public option that have been proposed are"
Liberal,as of right now the government plus americansinsurance and out of pocket costs are paying 5 trillion now and expected to be at 7t by 2028 anywayso you dont think there is a way to pay 6

Liberal,i think its more important to point out that you cant possibly comprehend that normal people can think differently than you you think that if someone doesnt agree with you that theres something wrong with them think about how narcissistic simplistic and dumb that sounds
Liberal,the fact you included if any isnt small and is a ridiculous thing to include
Liberal,"u2localboi you should definitely pay attention to this right hereboth the failed clinton health reform attempt and the effects of the reagan revolution

imo and ive said it before an entire generation of democratic party leadership is suffering from some form of collective ptsd from the shellacking ronald reagan gave them in the 80s and theyve just never recovered from it in terms of thinking about reframing the terms of the debate  one more reason we need the boomers to fuck off out of politics or at least their current stranglehold on it"
Liberal,i didnt mean of the candidates i meant that there were tons of liberals coming out to say that universal healthcare couldnt happen
Liberal,how did he delude the left im sure theres a small bitter minority that will think that way but they dont represent history
Liberal,arguably things like pell grants and the easy availability of student loans has grossly inflated higher ed prices
Liberal,"wouldnt lowering the cost be a step in the right direction i never said they were in favor of it just found it to cost less httpsthehillcomblogscongressbloghealthcare48430122studiesagreemedicareforallsavesmoney

Liberal,thats silly reasoning
Liberal,which website the bernie tax its based on bernie tax  m4a plan
Liberal,i mean my mom got cancer when she was 47 battled it for 6 years and died from it when she was 53 plenty of medical emergencies happen to people who are too young for them and while it might be your time when its your time a single payer system would ensure that you dont leave your family broke and deeply in debt after your time has come
Liberal,and also while diseases get more likely with age accidents can happen at any time spending weeks in the hospital after a bad car accident is going to be pricey and can literally happen any day
Liberal,"i pay for roads i do not drive on schools i do not attend police and fire services i do not call on and a whole host of other things that i do not personally currently use anything less is both shortsighted and selfish

one day you will find yourself relying on systems and services built by others who did not need those things themselves and as surely as ayn rand ended her life taking government assistance you also will take more than you have given from those who are both more sensible and more generous"

Liberal,i dont care that that is what is currently costs the whole discussion is that it shouldnt cost that much and there are better systems out there this is how we keep living under this system thats just what it costs ok guess we move on then
Liberal,what do you mean by this if your employer offers healthcare your rates for selfinsurance are going to be astronomical and some plans do not allow you to have secondary insurance
Liberal,that is the price for my wife and i
Liberal," maybe its because ive worked white collar jobs for the last 10 or so years

its definitely because of this ask some of your friends who are not in white collar jobs or lower tier office jobs"
Liberal,imagine if you tried to start your own business lack of public health care does plenty yo stifle entrepreneurship
Liberal,"would there be an income below which the premium is zero  

sure

what about deductibles  copays

depends on specifics of the plan and how you want it funded copays can be good in that they help align incentives for you to not go to the er for every small thing but are bad for preventative care putting rationing on the healthcare provider is probably better than copays in most scenarios as general people cant make a good informed decision about what to skip on"
Liberal,"no thats not what it was referring to

under a public option everyone who wants the public health insurance plan lets just use medicare as a short hand term for it would be allowed to get it but people who prefer their current private plans wouldnt be forced to give those up which they would be under a medicare for all plan so we exland access to insurance to everyone but there are still choices for people"
Liberal,"6t revenue just from taxes for just one thing how much extra taxes would everyone need to pay tp cover that and cover everything else taxes pay for

i dont know no one does because when asked every politician who does support m4a dances around the issue because to openly call for a tax increase is political suicide"
Liberal,three trillion more than what the federal government already pays  no one is saying its not possible you just have to show where that 3t comes from
Liberal,"the government can spend as much money as it wants without consequences is an internet talking point that is not born out in the real world full stop

Liberal,hah okay that was some penetrating cross examination there matlock well you know what pedantic means how about hyperbole do you know what that one means
Liberal,makes the most sense to me
Liberal,yeah theres lots of people whove been following politics for more than one or two elections anyone with an understanding of the situations knows why we arent going to be able to jump directly into a universal healthcare system and need to push it incrementally at this point i dont have to like it but that doesnt make it not obviously true
Liberal,"of course ive been known to be silly 


so help me not be silly whats the reason"
Liberal,im taking about methodology for other countries
Liberal,ive laid out my experience with the healthcare system elsewhere
Liberal,somehow weve made it this far as a country and a large portion of people dont die in medical debt
Liberal, ayn rand didnt die in poverty she wrote several bestsellers with the exception of anthem they arent much good but they were bestsellers
Liberal,"fair enough i swagged that number based on a couple of personal anecdotes from people i know personally  

even at 215k that debt at graduation costs the doctor 415k after interest etc

and all of the other points stand"
Liberal,"the money goes to medical groups which fund expensive equipment expensive staff liability research and lost billing  we know what medical groups make  

liability and the level of staff costs are different in the usa  billing costs are mostly usa specific  the top end of usa hospitals spend way more on equipment and research than their european counterparts"
Liberal,"or you read that the person who was billed 500 for a tylenol11 came into the ed with an active problem received monitoring from numerous professionals and had several diagnostic tests come back negative so all they got was a tylenol oh and their insurance paid for it 

if you hire an electrician to consult on a job youre paying 500 for them to look around a little but what theyre actually doing is assuring you what isnt a problem

hospital charge masters have been public for years now you can look in those and you wont see a single 500 tylenol"
Liberal," this is a disingenuous question the ridiculous profitability of corporate medicine is well known

if it is so well known then you should have no problem pointing to the tickers of medical groups with very high margins  nothing disingenuous about it 

 which alternative explanation do you offer  that over the counter medication is really that expensive or that the money falls into a void once paid

that 500 tylenol doesnt exist  it is a fable based on artificial cost structuring between insurance companies and hospitals  people who dont understand medical billing read medical bills and dont understand them their misunderstanding work themselves into popular consciousness  is medical billing in the usa so complex you need to be a professional to understanding it fully  yes absolutely  there is no reason individual americans should be seeing their bills outside the funding   capitation agreements contexts but that is not the same thing as ridiculous profits in the system as a whole that can be utilized to fund sanders dream projects at no cost"
Liberal,you do realize my explanation is that 400 a month is over a 50 decrease in cost over the current cost we pay today the most we could hope for would be a 66 cut bringing us in line with per capita costs in european countries however given how against limiting care americans are i suspect we will have higher costs than those countries even under similar systems because otherwise the right will easily destroy single payer because 72 year old grandparents with cancer were put on palliative care rather than given chemo which might have given them a few more years but at a high cost with poor prognosis
Liberal,self insurance being savings in addition to what my employer offers
Liberal,ok the person you are responding to is single   400 is still on the low side for single person on cobra
Liberal,id say that once you start introducing outof pocket costs you create a disconnect between universal in theory and universal in practice  i mean as it is you have people who technically have insurance but cant afford to use it
Liberal,ok but how would you ensure that everyone has access to the public insurance plan
Liberal,so its ok for the average american to pay 11kyear but not 5k in taxes instead of course it could be taxed different depending on income but how hard is to to wrap your mine around that the feds are already paying 2 out of the 3 trillionand americans out of their own pocket are paying 3 or so trillionwhich averages to 15 of the median income if the cost is actually almost halfas the congressional budget office it would be the feds already cover 66 of that 3trillion you dont think its possible for americans instead of paying 15 of their income they pay 5 increased taxes  so what your saying is americans can afford to pay 3 trillion per year in insurance and out of pocket costs but not 12trillion to cover the extra on top of what the feds are paying now
Liberal,"omg your not understandingin 2020 in usa the total healthcare spending was between 56trillion and expected to be above 7trillion by 2028  
2ish trillion is being paid by the feds and a little over 3trillion is being paid by the american people through insurance premiums copays out of pocket costs and things not covered by insurance so what if that 3trillion was going to the government in taxes instead of to insurance companies which a trillion ends up as profits to the health insurance industry which gets paid out as bonuss and stock dividends wouldnt it be crazy if instead of shoveling that money toward the shareholders it all went towards actual healthcare"
Liberal,you are aware that in a universal healthcare system you dont need to pay for insurance anymore right or copays when you see a doctor or deductibles and drugs get cheaper thats literally on average an extra 11k per year in each americans pocket of course some people just pay their 300month premium and nothing more and some people pay many times that but we are talking average here 11k per personout of their pockets not government moneyamericans money even if you increased taxes by 10 a majority of americans would be saving money
Liberal,"the government can spend as much money as it wants without consequences

no one that i can see at least in this thread has made this argument i did assert that the government can spend as much as it wishes this doesnt mean that there will be no consequences to spending that money in fact the whole point is that there are consequences if the government spends at a big deficit to provide medical care for more of its citizens that will have the consequence of more resources in the economy going to medical care for citizens and thats the point now of course you can make the argument that more resources for health care means less resources for other things of course this policy will have consequences both intended and unintended no one could seriously argue otherwise nobody here is arguing otherwise so why are you constructing this strawman"
Liberal,"if it is a part of it its a remarkably small part of it  its far more likely that the pent up demand in addition to labor shortage are driving it  that is unless you think the uss money printing causes inflation in other countries too even ones that didnt print money

i mean i suppose we could have let the demand fade away as households went broke and destroyed all their little wealth to stay afloat but i personally think that that would have caused a much worse economic downturn that would be far worse than the inflation were seeing now and would have had a lot more people more angry and in more ways than just voting angrily

there are so many factors but to whinge about a period of spending to save households is bullshit and should be left for the further right wing to complain about being as theyre uneducated and dont have any nuance"
Liberal,"im going to stick to my point because its very important multiple things can be important you framing people with a dissenting opinion as stupid and incompetent shows your unwillingness and or inability to even comprehend multiple viewpoints are the black americans who refuse to take the vaccine stupid and cant comprehend logical thought is their thought and for some a memory of the cdc injecting black americans with stds and lying to them that theyre giving them a cure not legitimate you dont even need to be a black american to be concerned about that  and thats just one of the concerns people have how about the fact that even if youre unvaccinated you still have less than 1 chance of being hospitalized let alone dying from covid 

argue the points stop dismissing people merely because they disagree with you"
Liberal,i dont know thats why im asking but your reasoning doesnt make sense as to why universal healthcare hasnt been implemented there are plenty of issues that are popular amongst the population but unpopular in congress
Liberal,a large portion of people dont die in house fires either yet your taxes still go to the fire department whether you ever use their services or not
Liberal,"rand underwent surgery for lung cancer in 1974 after decades of heavy smoking in 1976 she retired from writing her newsletter and after her initial objections allowed a social worker employed by her attorney to enroll her in social security and medicare

its wikipedia httpsenmwikipediaorgwikiaynrandbut they cite their sources and youre welcome to check them"
Liberal,you are getting downvoted too but you are absolutely right  ill add that often insurance companies and hospitals have billing agreements designed to offset certain costs with others  medical bills are highly misleading unless you know things like the capitation agreements  pretending this is just gouging is the sort of rhetoric that should be corrected  downvoting you for doing so is simply immoral
Liberal,"agreed i think i made that point

and cobra is great for 18 months to 3 years but thats not a permanent solution"
Liberal,"by making it a public option

letting people opt into it or auto enrollment for all 18 citizens with the ability to opt out"
Liberal,no i completely understand  lets go back to what i said no one is saying its not possible you just have to show where that 3t comes from  so what if that 3trillion was going to the government in taxes instead of to insurnace companies i agree i just think its reasonable for a proposal to include exactly how that 3t comes in through taxes and from whom etc instead of just saying taxes
Liberal,"yes but you still have to show exactly how that comes in the form of taxes

because when you speak in vague generalities you end up saying things that just arent true  for example the current system is only really expensive if you use it  if we switched to a single payer funded through broad based payroll taxes on average people would likely save money because in the current system those with high expenses in a year drive up the average a lot  but the majority would likely see an increase in cost overall in any given year because the median individual is not paying substantially more than their premiums every year"
Liberal,"uneducated and dont have any nuance

you are arguing that the government can spend as much usd as it wishes remember"
Liberal,"you are holding up a case of denial of medical treatment for poor americans as a rationale for the ongoing denial of medical treatment for poor americans and the irony of that position appears to be lost on you

if tuskegee was immoral what is 1000 insulin or making people pay for covid tests 

around 1 in 400 americans have died from covid around 1 in 12000 australians have died from covid explain to me how your system is better"
Liberal,id argue that a fire department makes more sense due to the fact that a fire can spread from house to house and that risk can not be properly contained to the individual who started the fire
Liberal,"that doesnt mean that she died in poverty every senior citizen gets and almost all of them use medicare and ss 

if you believe that taxes and social spending are immoral impositions on the public then its completely consistent to use those programs yourself  after all you paid taxes that you view are illegitimate which makes those benefits restitution"
Liberal,"thanks i appreciate it 

its sort of difficult when so many people seem determined to believe that our problems arise from mustachetwirling villains rather than large and complex systems  i dont know why its more appealing to refuse to attempt to understand complex systems but it is

its the same kind of thing as medicare for all will solve every problem  its not a reasoned position so a discussion of problems with it always gets a reflexive response youre a shillyou dont understandyoure lying"
Liberal,aca is typically cheaper   it is a solution   i have heard that it doesnt cover everyone but i dont know who it wouldnt apply too    one group would be people who cant afford the subsidized price some of whom are not prioritizing correctly but not all  i am not sure if it takes regional cost of living into account or not but it should
Liberal,"by making it a public option

i can buy private insurance on the aca exchange  what about being public makes it universal

are they public in the way that public schools are public  or are there premiums  deductibles copays"
Liberal,more or less yea  depending on what they do with taxes on the other end  and of course there is some limit but were not anywhere near it
Liberal,im the one who made that point and i think its pretty factual the government can create as much new money as it wishes for the purpose of spending thats not a policy position its just a fact of the way currency monopolies work
Liberal,yeah im not going to play this game where you just completely ignore everything i said and expect me to address your response we can continue or drop it here ill leave it up to you
Liberal,id argue that healthcare makes more sense since every american is 100 guaranteed to use doctors and medicine in their lives
Liberal,"i didnt say she died in poverty so im not sure where youre getting that i said she died relying on government benefits

as to accepting benefits youve paid for i dont object to that either  its literally the point of those benefits what i do object to is the hypocrisy of spending your life trying to deprive others of something and then enjoying it yourself"
Liberal,"it comes from sanders himself  for sanders everything was the fault of millionaires and billionaires  an honest person would talk about structural choices the american people made that had negative externalities  these can be changed but the positive implications of the choices drove those policies originally   instead yes everyone who disagrees is a shill ignorant or lying  the main difference between rightwing extremists and leftwing is whether they blame both the rich and the poor or only the rich  

im glad you call yourself neoliberal  i think the term was intended as an insult but the reality is it a good description for what the hillary wing stands for  under obama we didnt always have perfect policy but we almost always had an advocacy for rational policy  i hope our party is able to return to that"
Liberal,"in every state i have experience with aca prices are by county  so yeah regionality is factored in

my aca plan is the difference between retiring young or not being able to retire until medicare eligible so i am incredibly thankful that any solution exists"
Liberal,but the ability to pay for that service and the amount of services used varies wildly from person to person
Liberal,"happy to fly the neoliberal flag at the end of the day policy can only be judged on its results and not the intentions of the policy writers 

apparently thats madness to some people"
Liberal,"what i meant was does the amount of subsidy vary my region     prices are higher in some places does a personfamily  get a higher subsidy at the same income vs someone in a lower cost area

i agree that aca is great for retiring early   i am also retired early"
Liberal,"yup and if the fire service were privatized the exact same thing would be true some people would only need to get their cats out of trees ans some people would need to be rescued from highrise infernos but we have decided as a society that publicly funding a fire service is a benefit for society 

oh and your yeah but fires can spread from house to house argument is only a good argument in a world where there are no infectious diseases but since my neighbor can send me to the hospital for weeks by coughing covid into my face not sure it holds"
Liberal,in my experience the subsidy varies by state  im not sure if it gets more granular than that
Liberal,i realize that covid is rightfully in everyones mind i would argue that a system shouldnt be based on an event that occurs once every 100 years
Liberal,you know covid wasnt the first infectious disease weve had in 100 years right there are other infectious diseases covid was an example
AskReddit,"i had a staph infection on one of my toes

i ignored it

i ignored it until my foot was almost the size of a footballamerican and half my foot was black

i couldnt afford to take time off so i kept working when it started i worked the night i finally asked a friend to take me to the emergency room 

the only reason i decided to go was because i got extremely drunk like 34 of a 15 liter bottle of sailor jerrys drunk  i was worried about the 

anyways i got xrayed stuck in the magnet tube and had a bunch of tests ran

my main doc told me that i had to choose between half of my foot or half of my leg getting amputated

i chose half foot

when i woke up i still had my foot 

something about the infection not getting into my bone

doc also mentioned that there was evidence of maggots when he abraded the corrupted flesh off of me

i was in the hospital after that for a week my bill was almost 200k usd


yes guys i was stupid i should have gotten it looked at sooner i assure you all that i keep on top of things now 

i specified the american football thing because i was still able to cram my foot into my work boots barely i should have mentioned it initially

i was in a really bad place at the time having just lost my last remaining family member when i first started having problems with my foot i really did not give a single fuck about my well being

its been five years since and i promise i am doing much better mentally and physically i still owe the money"
AskReddit,"my current job is slowly driving me insane but i cant leave because my health insurance is through them and i cant take half the jobs i want because they either dont have it or have strings attached


if we had universal healthcare i could take far greater economic risks without having to worry about potentially being saddled with lifealtering debt from a clumsy misstep"
AskReddit,"i had a pretty wellpaid job making sure the health system i worked for got reimbursed by health plans 100000 support universal healthcare

i have an arsenal of stories on how truly fucked up the healthcare system here is but heres one that has stuck with me

reviewing a highdollar chemotherapy claim that was unpaid with my team ask them to pull the eob explanation of benefits that essentially outlines how the health plan paid what they did or why they didnt pay the health plan had marked the entire amount over 200k as patient responsibility meaning they were telling us to bill the patient for it

i personally called my counterpart at the health plan because it seemed like a mistake nope turned out the patient exhausted their benefits meaning they essentially ran out of coverage per the terms of their health insurance policy 

this was a ppo plan the patient had through work 

in other words this patient who is now fighting for their life and still in the middle of a cancer battle is going to get saddled with a 6 figure medical bill despite doing everything right by getting good coverage through a good job quite frankly if the cancer didnt kill them the stress of figuring out how to pay that would have 

this same health plan had an insanely ritzy office and so many perks for their executives it was beyond belief yet held nonprofit status 

made me sick to my stomach i left healthcare

edit to add

as someone who has seen the inner workings of the financial side of healthcare in the us i can say with 100 confidence that there is no good reason someone shouldnt support universal healthcare unless you own a ludicrous amount of health plan stock or at the executive level of a health plan please bear in mind that many countries that have universal healthcare still have private options so you arent entirely without choice"
AskReddit,yes because cancer is a bitch i had good insurance and it still fucked me over ill spend the rest of my life trying to pay this off and chances are i never will im not even 30 yet
AskReddit,"yes i want my relationship with my work to just be about money

my job and health insurance should not be intertwined at all"
AskReddit,"im sitting in my house with a torn something in my knee  probably ly still bleeding based on the spreading bruise  waiting two weeks for some lackey to decide that im worthy of an mri because i cant talk to an ortho without an mri because rules  all so i can pay for the er visit mri and probably most of the pt out of my own pocket which will set me
back years financially

yea i want health insurance i can go use when i actually need and not worry about it ruining me  give me all of that goodness

edit i should add that i have insurance  it i have a kid and my deductible is like 6000 dollars so i may as well not have insurance"
AskReddit,i dont want to change providers every time i change jobs  i also dont want to prop up an insurance industry worth billions of dollars  so yeah
AskReddit,yes i have worked in healthcare for 25 years and i cant afford to go to a doctor they act like its some huge favor fir the insurance companies to pay for yearly preventative care but god forbid they find anything on us deductibles are so high that youll go broke trying to pay for addition testing and treatment
AskReddit,"my infant son passed away after being in the nicu for five days luckily my partner and i each had different health insurance companies so the nicu stay was mostly covered

fuck united states healthcare"
AskReddit,"human resources rep here and i say absolutely every month i have to give benefits meetings and help employees coming from other companies or unemployment make decisions on insurance as well as those moving on to go somewhere else and help them all make potentially life changing decisions on insurance which they really dont even understand the basics

the doctor did a full exam for 30 we were expecting a huge bill after nothing ever came

yeah the healthcare system in the usa is utter corporatized filth burn it to the ground

edit oh lord i was just venting while drinking last night and i just came back to reddit tonight "
AskReddit,i have ms my health care was so much i stopped working and had to let my income fall below poverty line e so i could get medicaid other wise i would have died my monthly medical expenses was twice my salary either way i am broke at least this way i dont have medical debt so yes
AskReddit,americans  youre already paying for healthcare youre just not getting it your money is going elsewhere
AskReddit,wow i had no idea americas health care was so expensive you hear stories about it but reading some of these stories is truly terrifying its so disappointing to hear that people have to delay or forgo care because its unaffordable and also health is largely luck in that you dont know if youre going to get some illness and cant do anything to avoid many of them

AskReddit,"last year my mom went in to the hospital for covid this was very early 2020 when we still didnt really know how to treat it and while in there they found out two of her vertebrae had been destroyed by an infection in her spine so she had to be treated for covid and have an emergency spinal surgery she spent 103 days in various hospitals and rehabilitation centers and the total cost for all of it was approximately 500000 half a million dollars shes on social security because shes disabled so thankfully she had state insurance but if the state didnt offer insurance using only the money she would theoretically get from social security every month which is about 800 dollars it would take her about 52 years to pay it off making her 104 years old before it could be paid off

so yes i do want universal healthcare"
AskReddit,"absolutely and i would happily pay more taxes to make it happen everyone deserves the opportunity of early diagnoses everyone deserves medication to heal everyone deserve a quality life

i didnt get glasses until i was 26 because i was afraid of the cost i still have my wisdom teeth that flair up sometimes and cause pain 

i want to contribute so people arent financially ruined for being in an accident"
AskReddit,"reading all these comments i have concluded that

never be sick in america"
AskReddit,my brother got blood drawn from the er he now owes 4000 fuck yes we want universal healthcare
AskReddit,"dear god yes just let my taxes take care of it and cut out the blood sucking health insurance middle man 

they add nothing to our society they have allowed the american healthcare system to explode the price of services and medications because the consumer doesnt pay the real price as long as they have insurance in turn insurance premiums have exploded everyone involved makes billions off of the sick people who need care and prioritize any way they can avoid actually providing that care or insuring it

im already paying for my insurance so just use that money plus employers who cover it wouldnt need to pay those premiums and could pay workers more

i really challenge anyone to tell me why i shouldnt want one"
AskReddit,as a person who works for one of the evil healthcare businesses i support it with my whole being health insurance is a fucking scam

AskReddit,im stuck in a job i like but hate the schedule because of benefits even if my next job provides them rare in my industry itll be 3090 days before my new benefits kick in i have an ovarian cyst that is a ticking time bomb
AskReddit,"i am an american expat living in hong kong  i have lived in uk singapore and hong kong  all countries where there is universal healthcare

there is still a private healthcare industry and private insurance for that industry that operates in the free market alongside the government run public universal healthcare system

just because a universal healthcare system is implemented and taxpayers fund it doesnt mean that any of the other system is going away  it just means that people who cant afford private healthcare can actually get the care they need  it may also mean that the private healthcare system is optimized in terms of pricing since there is actually a cheaper transparent option

you may need to wait longer for noncritical procedures but its free  if  you dont want to wait then just pay for it and get it done faster

anyone who doesnt want universal healthcare just doesnt understand what is being proposed cant visual it or has been brainwashed by marketing and mainstream media influenced by greedy corporate interests

its an absolute nobrainer and a big win for the average person  the downside is that corporate profits of the private healthcare and insurance sector will be affected  the practices of vague unclear and extremely gouged pricing will also be exposed"
AskReddit,"as a brit this widespread repulsion towards the very idea of universal healthcare totally baffles me

i so often hear screams of socialism or communism just from hearing discussions about the possiblity of implementing it

im sorry but if all you need for something to meet the definition of socialist or communist is for it to be provided by the government and paid for out of general taxation then why isnt the us military socialism and communism or the police force or the fire service

in the uk we have both public and private healthcare theres a national health service which is free at the point of use for all available to all and paid for out of general taxation this means everyone in the uk is guaranteed healthcare regardless of their socialeconomic situation at any given time

we also have private healthcare for those who want and are able to pay extra for it which gives them the potential for faster access to care or a choice of their own specialist private gp etc depending of course entirely on what level of cover they take out

these things are far from perfect  the nhs is a constant political pingpong ball here in the uk and is always one of if not the biggest topics come election time

but the idea of not having healthcare free at the point of need and available to everyone unthinkable to me"
AskReddit,of course  im tired of paying more for less
AskReddit,"my parents got divorced when i was 6 and it was a nasty hateful and spiteful custody battle for nearly a decade

while in my mothers custody at age 11 my grandmother died it destroyed my already struggling mother a couple months prior was my most recent dentist visit and my last

my father got custody of me just as i turned 13 hes a qadjacent nutter nowadays but hes always been a bit irrational and arrogant took me to the doctor once he got custody to get me ripped off my asthma meds and never took me again even if he wanted to he was too broke to take me again i remember my brother getting 3rd degree sunburns and my father just giving him a few bottles of aloe and fish antibiotics

took myself to the er at 18 shit a massive amount of blood and my abdomen was in the greatest pain of my life doc said it was inflamed made me poop in a hat sent me home charged me 15k i swore off going to the doctor after that until i found a stable and consistent insurance policy that wouldnt leave me homeless im 25 now havent been since

also a bit more context ive had chronic tooth pain since i was 17 it ranges from mild annoyance to me debating getting drunk and having somebody rip them out with pliers

im recently unemployed and thanks to covid medicaid expansions i qualify for a medical card for the first time in my adult life i got to go see a dentist last week theyre scheduling me for a deep cleaning apparently all my teeth can be saved need the wisdoms removed though i also finally got glasses ive desperately needed since i was young its concerning that i was driving before without glasses i also am getting some other chronic medical issues looked at in the coming months

even with a medical card it hasnt been easy no oral surgeon within 3 hours of where i live accepts medicaid unless youre under 18 so ive got to drive clear across the state to get my wisdom teeth removed no dentist within half an hour so i have to go out of county to get cleaned my local er doesnt take my form of medicaid so i have to go to the next county over if something comes up

ive had to spend hours calling literally over one hundred places to find something that accepts medicaid worse ive had a few instances where the secretary volunteered all the common forms of insurance they dont accept did you know that theres no shortage of private reputable insurers that are just widely unaccepted you can have top end insurance and still struggle to find a doc in your area

im so goddamn angry i did it by the book for seven goddamn years worked full time from 1623 nonstop part time afterwords because i enrolled into university didnt take my first fucking day off until i got the flu busted my ass tried new jobs learned new skills never fucking had the opportunity to get basic medical help i did it all lanscaping facotry cleaningassembly warehousing mechanic freelance marketer freelance auto mechanic farm equipment mechanic nonprofit caregiver forklift operator hell i found myself as professional tcg playervendor never once did i find myself in a position to where i could see a goddamn optometrist dentist or general practitioner

nobody especially not another child deserves to go through what ive experienced our system is broken and we need to take drastic measures to fix it anybody that says otherwise is a fucking delusional sociopath and needs fucking kicked in the goddamn teeth

you know what universal healthcare does it makes it to where kids in rough homes can just walk in and schedule their own goddamn appointments when their parents are too nuts or poor to do it for them it makes it to where people like me who can barely afford to fucking live dont have to drive 3 goddamn hours to get a tooth ripped out

maybe my case sounds extreme but its fucking not 13 americans are in the same boat

as far as im concerned theres no reasonable or rational debate against universal healthcare the opposition has had decades to find a counterproposal but theyd rather pretend there isnt a problem fuck them and anybody that aligns with them

not only am i entirely in favor of universal healthcare im here to attest that anybody against it is a worthless piece of shit unworthy to be fed to pigs"
AskReddit,i am an american i have a great job and employerprovided health insurance that i pay a portion of and yes yes yes i think universal healthcare is needed i needed a biopsy done on a lump found during a mammogram after my insurance paid a portion of it i got a bill for 3500 that will take me a year or more to pay that off and what if something else happens within that year so why the hell am i paying for health insurance if im still getting a huge bill its absolutely ridiculous
AskReddit,i just had to not go to the er because i couldnt afford it the only people who dont want universal healthcare are the rich and the brainwashed
AskReddit,"i have not seen a doctor or dentist in years i was about to say i could take it or leave it but now that i think about it wtf am i paying for then

edit to clarify if im paying for insurance i dont use what is the difference in just putting it in my taxes to pay for everyones instead  right now im just handing insurers money for free when i could be paying for someone elses healthcare who currently is getting not a damn thing"
AskReddit,the only people who dont want it are insurance companies
AskReddit,"im american i have lived in taiwan and the uk and have greatly benefited from the formers nhi and the latters nhs and its madness that the us has no such system healthcare is a fundamental human right and it should not bankrupt people

when healthcare is cheap or free people go to the doctor early and that allows ailments to be caught early so they dont develop into worse situations that saves money and lives"
AskReddit,i do want universal healthcare i know people who dont want it because they think the quality will decrease the people i know who feel that way have so far not had to deal with a medical expense beyond their means have very little experience outside of the us and only know about other countrys systems by rumor and believe the propaganda that our healthcare system is fast and high quality
AskReddit,we are already paying enough taxes to have it  yes i want it  i dont even go to the hospital or doctor because i cant afford it
AskReddit,"yes completely and entirely i left the us years ago for a country with socialized health care and its one reason i havent gone back

the people i know opposed to universal healthcare are either 1 fantastically rich 2 have never traveled 3 are antiscience or 4 have never been superbly sickinjured they have no perspective and struggle to understand the stress and expense of maintaining health"
AskReddit,"the american health care system

an orwelliandystopian disaster that makes me cringe every time i read what our american friends have to deal with and think is even normal

you always say youre free yet i cannot think of any other country where its people are under the yoke of such an oppressive and discrimination based health system

you cannot make this shit up"
AskReddit,"absolutely

i feel anyone who is opposed to universal healthcare just really hasnt taken a look at the numbers

virtually every american yes you stands to save money with a universal healthcare system

every other developed nation is paying around 13 to 12 our healthcare costs per capita with similar quality of care metrics

anyone who wants to pay 2x to 3x the price for the same service is an idiot full stop"
AskReddit,yes why medical debt is the 1 cause of bankruptcy in the usa it costs the tax payers more than if we had it
AskReddit,"you have to understand what we want is irrelevant because we have exactly zero influence in the united states governmenthttpsbulletinrepresentusamericangovernmentisntdemocracy

AskReddit,yes people act like government funded healthcare is some socialist takeover of america but uh what do you think medicaid and medicare are they are already government funded health care also look at other corporations funded primarily by taxpayer dollars nasa npr do you think government officials are running them no they only step in if theyre needed why not use the tax payer dollars to fund something beneficial to the welfare of the people and do away these fat cat executives who rake in millions of dollars in profit at the expense of the medical system which is what makes it so expensive in the first place
AskReddit,"i had an emergency csection and then had post partum hemorrhaging and hour or two later where i lost a little over 3 liters of blood was sent home the day after without a blood transfusion because the doctor who came in just straight up asked me if i needed a blood transfusion while i was still dealing with the aftereffects of im having a hard time remembering the name where they put medication through a spinal cord the doctor then said no i dont think you need a blood transfusion k bye and left they took out my catheter after he left and of course i immediately had to go to the bathroom i had to get help going to the toilet because they couldnt find a commode and while sitting on the toilet trying to go the bathroom i immediately started going in and out of consciousness i looked over at the nurse and said im going to black out she has to grab a wheelchair because she wouldnt be able to get me off the floor if i fell down so they get me in the wheelchair and i black out i woke up to her slapping me awake and telling me not today after that i was in and out of the hospital with severe anemia for about a month then my wound got infected and i had an abscess about the size of a grapefruit stuck where my csection wound was severely high fever my skin was hot touch was bright red all over my stomach they put a picc line in my arm gave me anabiotics and i stay in the hospital for about a week while i was under observation the antibiotics did jack shit i was in an out of the hospital several more times and then i went to a post pregnancy check up with my obgyn and she suggested i see a wound specialist i am completely flabbergasted that hospital staff who are supposed to be taking care of me did not suggest this i went to see the wound specialist he took one look at it said that the people at the hospital are complete fucking idiots and how could they missed some thing this obvious and think that antibiotics were just going to fix it he scheduled me for an emergency surgery that saturday which was like two days away when i get there one of the nurses insisted that i take a pregnancy test you can imagine her surprise when i said this is a csection wound theres no way i got pregnant and her response was well you couldve had sex you never know and i said  i havent had sex since i was two months pregnant especially not after postpartum hemorrhaging and all the trauma that comes with that i can barely sit down to pee what makes you think that i can hold a cup and bend over to do a pregnancy test im not taking that and thank god one of the nurses who ive vaguely remember seeing helping me in the maternity ward talked to that nurse and she left me alone after that surgery i got a wound vac and a visiting nurse who was wonderful to me she was probably the kindest person ive ever met and she helped me get through the toughest time in my life my wound after that surgery was over 7 inches deep maybe a little more because i remember her sticking in one of those really long qtips that nurses use to clean inside of wounds and the whole damn thing fit inside it took me like three months to fully heal my wound was open for 6 12  7 months

now you may be asking why im telling you this story im telling you this story because the amount of out of network not covered by insurance doctors and specialists that i had to see to save my life ended up sending me in to medical debt over something that was not my fault and i had no control over i couldnt even sue the hospital for malpractice and neglect because they literally have every single lawyers office in my state under retainer and they all chalked it up to fortunate accident rather than poor treatment and malpractice 
this all happened in 2018 at the beginning of the year i just recently had to file for bankruptcy because of all the debt that was acquired before during and after the pregnancy and the surgeries etc etc i was so messed up and still trying to heal after that whole deal that i just left my job because i didnt have anymore short term  long term disability fmla only covered so much i felt the only way i could explain to them because they were all about your image and how things look was by lying and saying that my fianc found a way for me to be a stay at home mom but in reality i was dealing with ptsd severe distrust of hospital and doctors postpartum depression all of this went untreated because after i left my job i lost all my benefits and i was on state healthcare and they didnt cover therapy and things like that 

after that i spent the better part of a year almost 2 years possibly three and severe depression i gained so much weight so on top of all the depression i was over 150 pounds more than when i was first pregnant with my daughter im still dealing with all of that weight now and im still on state healthcare i have tried to get help to lose weight but the state healthcare doesnt cover seeing a nutritionist seeing a dietitian etc i am trying my damn hardest ive been on and off birth control since last year because i mysteriously started having no period for almost a year and then suddenly severe bleeding to the point where i am changing a super plus tampon and large nighttime pad every 30 minutes it was only until the last couple months that my obgyn and i finally found a birth control pill that sort of works but she made it a point to tell me that before we can go any further i have to lose weight because apparently what needs to happen like scans etc they cant see past my fat i have been slowly losing weight ive lost 35 pounds since the beginning of the year and its been fluctuating 

the whole point to the above story is if our country had universal healthcare i would not have been on the hook for thousands and thousands of dollars for something that was completely out of my control and done to me i would have been able to get the help i needed for my ptsd postpartum depression my severe anxiety stress etc etc i would have been able to see nutritionists and dietitians people who could help me lose weight because i have over 250 pounds i have to lose and 35 pounds just a drop in the bucket i cry a lot and deal with people who think that its ok to comment and point out my weight and remind me how fat i am and it just makes it hard not to go back to just stress eating and hide away so that i can avoid people and not have to hear that crap

at this point we are struggling because even if i wanted to go back to work to get health insurance unless it paid more than my fianc we could not afford it but im not going to go down that rabbit hole and talk about that 


tldr emergency csection postpartum hemorrhaging and lost 3 liters of blood incompetent hospital in and out of hospital for severe anemia infected csection wound picc line wound vac visiting nurse who was a saint 7 deep wound open for 6 127 months severe depression ptsd postpartum depression severe anxiety left work and lied to save my image telling them im becoming a stay at home mom gained lots of weight strapped with medical debt until just recently when i filed for bankruptcy on state healthcare and still cant get the therapy i need cant go see a nutritionist or dietitian etc etc  i cant even get new glasses that have been broken for a year 

i share the story to help further the case that universal healthcare should be a thing im not sharing this so that people can debate my life and the traumas that ive been through so that they can make their political point im not their fucking statistic to use i dont know how or why it is so hard for other people to understand its not socialist to want universal healthcare i dont want someone else to deal with what i did because of our shitty ass healthcare system why would anyone want somebody to go through that because there are millions of stories more fucked up than mine or people are stranded with millions of dollars of debt and they can barely survive how is this ok with people"
AskReddit,"hell yes i do

i lived in japan for six years i ended up needing a wisdom tooth taken out cost me less than 50 i needed to take the other three out here in the us i spent a month discussing with the dentist the price called insurance confirmed pricing with all parties my cost was only supposed to be 1200 scheduled an appointment for three months later

in the meantime i had a routine dental cleaning

three months after my surgery after id paid for everything i got a bill from the dentist saying i owed more than 600 more i called the insurance company frantic and confused because of that routine cleaning it put me over some arbitrary yearly limit on dental work so i needed to pay the rest on my own

it would have been cheaper for me to fly to japan get the other three done and have a decently long vacation to boot

finally we already pay a federal medicare tax thats higher than what some countries pay for their healthcare on top of insurance and deductibles cant access it til were retired and even then its horrible coverage that needs supplemental insurance to even be helpful"

AskReddit,"im a wound care nurse in the us and this happens so often patients will put off a wound thinking its not that bad its a 5050 by the time they get to our clinic if we can heal said wound or if they need to be admitted for an amp 

for other patients with wounds on their feet its convincing them to stay off of it to help it heal many cant and it bumps our goal heal time from 14 weeks to 20 weeks and a whole bunch of frustration 

for the love of god why isnt our insurance better i know why but dont want to get into it"
AskReddit,"we can probably agree on two things
1healthcare costs are absurd 
2youre not the sharpest crayon in the box mate"
AskReddit,i had the same happen to me staph infection in my foot 3 weeks at mgh in boston had 3 surgeries woke up each time thinking id have less than my whole foot i had massachusetts health care plan its a free health plan if you make xx of an income i was homeless they paid for everything no bills still have foot
AskReddit,you cant have uh because corporations need you to feel trapped otherwise youd go work somewhere else and theyd have to spend money to replace you
AskReddit,thats one factor of the us system that id be curious to see some stats on what is the estimated loss in productivity and innovation from people being stuck in jobs for the insurance how many people would love to go have a crack at starting a business or making a product of their own but cant because they cant afford the insurance and so cant risk losing what their job provides
AskReddit,and not even a clumsy misstep on your part drunk driver hits you even though you did everything right on your end cool youre alive but youre in so much debt that life isnt worth living anymore
AskReddit,"when my mother was dying she was receiving treatment at the hospital she worked at she was previously a nurse for 25 years but had moved to billing 5 years earlier 

the insurance company tried to tell the hospital what they would or wouldnt cover for my mother a decadeslong hospital employee receiving treatment in their own hospital 

her colleagues told us not to worry about it and the talks about what was and wasnt covered never happened around us again 

i often think how it wouldve gone if she hadnt been their employee and hadnt worked in the department she worked it and hadnt been getting treatment in their hospital its so fucked 

at the end after she died we got a bill for 198m but our portion was supposed to be 900 we just threw it away hey assholes shes dead go shake the change out of her corpse if you want it that badly 

the whole system is a mess"
AskReddit,"i have a good jobinsurance too

my wife needed a procedure once  without it she would now be blind

the doctor told us that we needed a permission letter from our insurance before they would do the procedure

the procedure was 45000 and they wanted to make certain the money was in place before they would help my wife

we had to get permission first

yeah  our healthcare system is absolutely fucked"
AskReddit,i work in the financial part of healthcare i came into this job having a neutral opinion on universal healthcare slanted towards a freemarket solution within a year i am 100 onboard universal healthcare our healthcare isnt just a sick joke its run by sociopaths
AskReddit,"i grew up with universal healthcare now live in the us with insurance a couple years back i ended up in the er with a head injury needing stitches and blacking out repeatedly the doctor informed me that my insurance wouldnt cover a ct scan and therefore they couldnt tell me i had to get the ct but that i really had to get the ct that look in her eyes ugh lifedefining to be on the receiving end of it but i can only imagine how many times a day she has to give that very look to people in situations like mine

through the entire ordeal the accident the bleeding gash down my chin the repeated fainting once while standing at a window as my insurance info was being run before i could receive any treatment repeatedly telling the nurse i needed to sit down because i was about to black out again then did the stitches everything i burst into tears exactly once and that was when i googled the prices for ct scans after the doctor informed me she couldnt give me a ballpark of the costs

i got it bc f it i can fly to my home country and its universal healthcare ifwhen i get cancer or another longterm disease but i cant walk out of an er let alone fly 6000 miles with a potentially undiagnosed brain injury that could kill me within the next 24 hours

i was fine concussed and suffered ice pick headaches for months afterwards which i never sought treatment for because f my insurance but i dont regret agreeing to pay thousands of dollars out of pocket for something as emergent as that i regret moving to the us and setting up a life here where even with an expensive selfemployed insurance policy the worst part of getting sick or injured is the fear of getting medical treatment"
AskReddit," please bear in mind that many countries that have universal healthcare still have private options so you arent entirely without choice

german here yeah you can still buy additional insurance if you want a single room in the hospital or want to be treated by the head doctor only or less copay for dental work etc

but the basics are covered and no one needs to wonder if they can afford to get their fucking cancer treated"
AskReddit,"health plan here 100000 support universal healthcare

i dont believe ill be out of job but if thats the consequence im still 100000 support it"
AskReddit,exhausted benefits are now illegal i think or only for aca plans
AskReddit," please bear in mind that many countries that have universal healthcare still have private options so you arent entirely without choice

dane here yeah we do have private options and good jobs will come with improved health insurance so we can skip line if there is one for a needed examprocedure by going to a private clinic

however  that is not the only choice we have which doctor we want is entirely up to us we can at all times swap to any other doctor who is taking on new patients iirc we can do so every six months or pay 200 dkk 30 usd to do so or we can just book an appointment with another doctor for free

all this fox news shit about people losing their doctors is a made up problem simple fear mongering"
AskReddit,if i may how much the treatment costed you
AskReddit,declare bankruptcy only lasts 7 years right
AskReddit,ill be honest now i think of it as a brit that is weird your work have anything to do with your health its weird they are not separate i work in one of the largest insurance companies in the world based in the uk im just a worker bee if i get cancer im guaranteed 5k from my employer thats the only time they have anything to do with my health
AskReddit,now that you mention it that is kind of a weird americanism that you dont a lot
AskReddit,i know someone who lost her husband because some lackey decided he didnt need a heart mri while they were waiting for the appeal to go through he died guess what it was something that would have been found with the mri and would have been immediately treatable and he would have lived people always bring up wait times in countries with universal healthcare they dont ever talk about our system where we pay out of the nose and still have to wait or get flat out denied
AskReddit,feel this hope things look up for you
AskReddit,"when i snapped my acl i visited the doctor 0 went for an mri 200 8 days later i was in surgery and stayed overnight 0 i paid 75 gap for each follow up with the ortho then 0 for each physio appointment 

i pay 50month for private health insurance this also includes optical and ambulance cover"
AskReddit,i was in a similar situation a couple of months ago long story short i had to go to 2 drs the first one did not want to do an mri till the next visit in two weeks probably to get more money out of my insurance the second one ordered mri right away still had to pay about 500 dollars out of pocket even though i have pretty decent insurance they scheduled me another appointment so he could go over the results which wouldve taken about 5 minutes through a phone conversation but yea you guessed it they wanted to get more money out of my insurance had to pay deductibles for all this shit btw dr ordered physical therapy which i ended up skipping it because i wouldve had to pay 50 out of pocket i have plenty more fucked up us healthcare system stories i dont give a shit what anyone says healthcare should not be a business
AskReddit,same shit im going through on two fronts one my hands are constantly going numb and tingly on me and my sternum pops when i lift my shouldercant see ortho second have had upper left quadrant pain for 6 months and rectal paincannot get a colonoscopy because im too young still paying a shitload cause ive gone to the doctor 5 times in the last 6 months trying to get these issues taken care of i fucking hate us healthcare
AskReddit,deleted
AskReddit,the politician that manages to divorce health carehealth insurance from employment will be revered through history
AskReddit,forgive my ignorance  what do you mean you have to change providers every time you change jobs
AskReddit,yes because people deserve healthcare without incurring debt in my opinion
AskReddit,"i dont particularly like my job most of the time but my insurance as well as other benefits is pretty amazing so unless universal healthcare is sorted out and isnt crippled by politicians it looks like 30 more years where im at


yay

thankfully i get lots of vacation days too"
AskReddit,i saw this somewhere on the internet not sure of how accurate it is but basically insurance companies wanted lower prices from hospitals but they couldnt get them because they were already pretty cheap so they jacked up the prices so much that insurance companies pay what people had to pay initially while people without insurance get fucked over with hyperinflated prices so that theyre forced to get insurance once again not sure how accurate that information is
AskReddit,removed
AskReddit,"cant afford to go to the doctor is way too many of us

my insides are broken im in pain at various points throughout the day every single day and you can hear constant gurgles and other sounds to the point its embarrassing but after the initial investigations by doctors turned up no cause even though they agreed something is wrong i cant afford to find out anything more or see any more doctors so every day it gets a little bit worse and i can do nothing because i live in the usa

it sucks"
AskReddit,thats awful and heartbreaking
AskReddit,we are currently 30 days into the nicu with twin girls likely have another 1530 days to go we are being billed at about 10000day per baby
AskReddit,truly heartbreaking i dont know what to say or think but thats the most shocking thing ive read on this thread
AskReddit,im so sorry for your loss and for the horrible way the medical system treated you the us system clearly lacks compassion
AskReddit,"shit like this is why i hate late term abortion bans its cruel to force a women to carry a nonviable fetus to term and then make her watch the baby suffer in the nicu until death and then get slapped with the bill thats what those those compassionate laws do not to mention the trauma of having to go through a full term pregnancy and face excitement from others knowing that your baby will only live a few days at most

i know this may not be your situation but it happens and republicans seem to want it to happen more so they can get jesus points 

and im terribly sorry for your loss"
AskReddit,im astonished american business isnt clamoring to jettison all the hassle of healthcare benefits and replace it with a simple tax
AskReddit,big part of it is the terminology coinsurance no speak plainly  im paying out of pocket because insurance doesnt cover 100 of the cost
AskReddit,"i find this so scary  

a couple of years ago our then 9yo daughter fell off her bike and ruptured her spleen i drove her to our nearest hospital which is an hour away where we attended ae we spent six hours at the local hospital whilst they assessed what was wrong and this included pain relief sonogram and a ct scan once they found the ruptured spleen we were transferred by air ambulance to the royal childrens hospital in melbourne  which would have been a 45 hour drive where she stayed for six days seeing the best childrens sugeons etc

and how much did that cost us you ask nothing aside from the 80 per year fee to be in ambulance victoria and rch melbourne is literally one of the leading kids hospitals in the world"
AskReddit,in finland that same ambulance ride would be 25 euros if the accident is in a remote placebad enough theyll send a chopper which costs you about 9 euros
AskReddit,"so in us you can attack someone and make them go bankrupt
what did doctor say at the end i suggest avoid getting stabbed for next couple of weeks"
AskReddit,"as an australian this is a very clear argument to me in favour of universal health care

i take it thats how it was intended  see i try to understand the american psyche and reasoning for not wanting universal health care and i fail at it  this absolutely clear and obvious to me reason for needing universal health care seems not to work on a lot of americans else i would have thought you guys would have it already

i pay 100 a year for ambulance cover meaning ambulance rides are free and i could be taken to a public hospital and get emergency surgery and any required hospital stay for free including food everything  id walk out of hospital with no outofpocket costs except for any medication i might need after leaving hospital  and even thats mostly covered by the government so itll be maybe 40ish

so to recap in australia the following is free of charge

 any treatments or surgeries in a public hospital
 your stay in a public hospital
 any tests and scans you have done while in a public hospital and most simple tests and scans you have outside of one too
 all or most of your visit to a general practice doctor
 part of your visit to any specialist doctor
 the bulk of the cost of an ambulance ride  or the entire cost if you pay a small yearly membership fee
 part of the cost of mental health consultations
 part of the cost of pharmacy medications including almost all the cost of any expensive ones

note that i said in a public hospital a few times  that represents our main hospital system but we also have private hospitals which are a tier above in terms of care level and waiting lists for nonurgent procedures and you pay for that privilege  we have health insurance to pay large portions of the costs associated with private hospitals and consultants and there are government incentives to take out such insurance  so on balance its not outrageously expensive to get private hospital stays or treatments

if you come out of hospital after emergency surgery you have enough to worry about with the pain and trauma of your injury and recovery  itd be silly to have to worry about money"
AskReddit,the kicker with us for me is if you get cancer lets say its pretty much over youll either die or youll survive but be killed by the debt anyways
AskReddit,removed
AskReddit,honestly as a brit the mere mention of being charged for an ambulance ride makes me think what the fuck
AskReddit,"and the rest of the world question why people dont intervene in conflicts in america

its not worth it to risk the rest of your life for it

terrible world to live in the american dream is not a thing outside of america its something that americans tell americans"
AskReddit,deleted
AskReddit,thats just horrible i was once changing jobs and my kids insurance is through me as it happened due to some clerical issue my insurance was not sorted out and my kid fell and had symptoms of the brain concussion i took him to the hospital where he underwent some tests and three days of observation the invoice was exactly 0 he even got a toy on discharge thats europe for you
AskReddit,"in canada i broke my hand had a 3 hour wait in emergency that night when the doctor finally saw me i got a splint and some t3s and was sent home for the night they scheduled a surgery for 9am the next morning out of recovery in time to go watch the fights at the bar with my friends got more t3s paid 0 total dont know why you wouldnt want a socialist system like ours but whatever make your own choices

edit for the people who said canadians pay more in taxes for it bc and ontario have an employer health tax system where you pay a tax as a company on your payroll volume some nonprofits and small businesses are exempt and some huge corporations pay a higher rate based on what your yearly payroll volume is not entirely sure but i think that albertas tax rate is almost nothing so it would just be the federal taxes that you pay there as they fund a lot of their stuff with their oil money its different across the country though the federal government does have some of their tax money thats provided to provances to spend on healthcare"
AskReddit,"i met an american guy this summer at a party he has type 1 diabetes and has had it for most of his life he simply lost the genetic lottery even with insurance he has to pay 200 800 a month for insulin in sweden hed only have to pay roughly 275 a year because thats the maximum you have to pay in a 12 month period for prescription medicine that is ruled necessary also insulin is a special case its free with a prescription of course

i will go under the knife for minor surgery on the 23rd of this month for this i will pay the princely sum of 47 i almost died to a dangerous new strain of the flu as a child i was hospitalized for weeks countless tests were done on my blood my parents paid a minor fortune to keep me alive wait i mistyped that my parents paid a pittance roughly 200

i convinced the american guy to make a concerned effort to immigrate to sweden hes in the process of doing so now"
AskReddit,deleted
AskReddit,"the big thing to take away is that plenty of other countries have tried countless other systems single payer two tier totally publicly funded etc many of them have pretty good outcomes and its healthy to debate the merits of each one

what is universally true though is that the american system is by far the worst its like someone took the worst things out of all the systems and combined them together"
AskReddit,i dont even care about the potential loss of jobs at this point the system is poison and corrupt find a better industry
AskReddit,fwiw you should always get travel insurance it costs about 50 bucks but usually covers medical issues into the millions and will even pay for things like a medically supervised flight home
AskReddit,30e  you have been robbed i usually pay 25e
AskReddit,"this was our plan when we thought our daughter 2 at the time might have a heart defect i was going to quit so shed qualify for the state health insurance that would pretty much cover it all i even asked my job what my options were because our insurance sucked and they told me honestly quit and get state insurance  then come back when shes better 





luckily it was something minor that didnt require surgery but the echo alone cost me 900 after insurance and we had to pay at least half of it up front or our 2 year old would have been denied care"
AskReddit,hospitals deliberately and carefully conceal costs so theres no way to identify waste to pint at a hospital and say  they charge twice as much for worse care its a black box that needs to change
AskReddit,we literally pay more overall per person than we would with taxes supported universal healthcare
AskReddit,"this is the argument that i always bring up to morons that defend our current system were paying out the ass multiple times 

our taxes already go towards healthcare in different ways and then we have to pay insurance and then after all that we have to foot the bill for the chunk that insurance doesnt cover which they try weasel their way into making as much as possible

the system is disgusting and were slaves to its whims"
AskReddit,"bingo canadians receive the same care as we do arguably better for everyone but certainly better for the middle class and poor and they get that on less money than our government spends on healthcare

think about that our government already spends enough to cover everyone then we spend that much again for no reason at all

its a joke a sick joke"
AskReddit,"this we are living in a corrupt government one where the politicians are being paid to do nothing for the citizens

any chance of reform will be struck down and as much as id love to see it happen it most certainly wont

forget health care what about climate change the usa is doing virtually nothing to try and change the corporations behavior to pollution

httpswwwfollowthemoneyorg

it makes sense as the corporations give billions of dollars to politicians to make sure it stays that way do not be fooled by the illusion of democracy for that will be our downfall

we only have a certain amount of time to spread the word en masse to try and reach the public before its too late we are nearing the tipping point and nobody seems to care

well i care and i hope you do too because i want to grow up in a world where i will be happy to contribute to my country where i could raise a child and have my own business a society in which nobody is afraid that they will go into debt

please check out my movement if you are interested in contributing

united we stand or together we fall"
AskReddit,we know representatives dont care
AskReddit,"even more disappointing to me are the droves of people even liberal democrats who go out of their way to defend our current health system

the last two democratic party presidential primaries had universal healthcare as a main topic both times the candidate who opposed universal healthcare won this is our left party"
AskReddit,"i went to see my pediatrician as a teen about my debilitating joint pain and what was later discovered to be repetitive dislocations from a connective tissue disorder and the doc straight up refused to refer me for testing or any specialist barring any possibility of my insurance at the time covering it because you dont want to be diagnosed with anything you dont want a preexisting condition youll have a hard time getting insurance as an adult

in her defense the realities of hellscape america might have prevented me from getting insurance when i aged out of my moms insurance before obama but that still didnt and doesnt fix my debilitating pain"
AskReddit,you pay more in taxes but that amount that is taken out weekly for health insurance goes away  and the amount in taxes you pay is less than what youre paying for health insurance now every paycheck  its just stupid right now the argument against it
AskReddit,i make six figures in health insurance id vote for a universal payer in a heartbeat because its the right thing to do hell between myself and employer insurance is already about 2k per month why not just pay that in tax
AskReddit,fun fact if you want to get travel insurance assuming where you live offers it it costs extensively more if you want it to cover travel to the us
AskReddit,1200 dollar bill for my er visit last year for covid only to be told there is nothing they can do if i get hit by a car or something that disables me just pull the plug so i dont have to live in debt and everything i worked for taken away from me
AskReddit,to this date i still dont understand the point of the insurance part of health insurance yes you pay into something that will take care of you later but dont you do the same for a public system with your taxes and whats the point of insurance if they dont do their job which is to pay out when something does happen
AskReddit,it doesnt make sense that have to pay so much for it our constitution gives us a right to an attorney if we cant pay for one the government will provide us one why dont we have the same with healthcare healthcare is a human right but the government is acting like its a privilege
AskReddit,i broke my collar bone last year and all up it cost me 60 for all treatment xrays pain meds physiotherapist   i feel sorry for my us counterparts
AskReddit,"same in spain we have pretty good public healthcare its terrifying when i hear some people say theyd prefer fully private healthcare so we dont have to pay it with our taxes i think only a minority thinks like that but still

i pray we never ever try to imitate usa in healthcare or education"
AskReddit,"two main reasons from my understanding living here

1 theres a selfsufficiency culture thats fostered by politics and geography its easy to see paying more money in taxes for anything you wouldnt see return on as a waste of money a 2 hr drive to see a specialist or even a gp is really common for alot of people 

2 we dont trust how it would be implemented our government is viewed as corrupt who openly take bribes in exchange for government contracts a universal healthcare system would either be slowclunky andor privatized 

theres also a strong chance that the money paid in taxes would get found and spend elsewhere like with social security its an insurance plan thats been well funded and around for a long time and its always on the verge of being nixed because they dont have the money they spent instead of investing 

btw im 100 for universal healthcare but i think we need to fix how politicians fund raise for campaigns here first"
AskReddit,just curious has anybody seen the british version of breaking bad  i heard it sucked
AskReddit,"i am sorry you had to go through all of that as an european this seems somewhat scifi what you are saying my greatest medical bill was perhaps 40  people were staging massive strikes against 2  mandatory onetime payment for visiting a doctor to make sure you dont visit a doctor unless needed we are talking bruised knees here

other than that visiting a doctor for me was always a decision between cant be bothered to drive 10 minutes there and wait an hour for an examination and its not so bad

never had a major issue maybe because of huge preventative care here if you have an issue its usually found out early and people never hesitate to call an ambulance or go to a doctor if they feel its serious i semibroke my clavicle when i was 13 i remember getting 300  an a compensation for the pain from my insurance company they literally paid whole treatment meds and then they gave me 300  i had a colonoscopy checkup in which they pump huge amount of air into your colon felt pretty fucked after that pun not intended  the doctor offered me an ambulance to take me back home free of charge of course 25 km europe is small

it is recommended you visit your dentist every 6 month for regular checkup for which you pay nothing you pay for extra services in case you want a better filling for example

to just not praise the system to heavens you perhaps wont get the best toptier treatment thats available in the us especially with a superrare disease but if we are talking numbers game this is 1000 better than the us healthcare in which many people dont even visit the doctor due to the aforementioned reasons

yes i pay bigger taxes and dont make 80k usd a year but i live a stressfree except the selfinduced lol life without a fear that something will go wrong on top of that because we have also a fairly good social security system you will never end up on a street when loosing a job especially with children you would have to sabotage the system bigtime to end up homeless beat children spend all social security money for alcohol etc"
AskReddit,"the common attitude among americans who dont support universal health care seems to be that they dont feel they should have to contribute toward someone elses medical treatment like people should just stop getting sick

i dont understand it"
AskReddit,an hr manager at a previous job didnt want it because she knew someone who knew someone who had to wait a bit of time for a non life threatening knee surgery in canada so theres also janice
AskReddit," i dont even go to the hospital or doctor because i cant afford it

AskReddit,5 make bank on the healthcare industry
AskReddit,"i did some rough math a year or so ago adding up what my wife and i pay for insurance doc  dentist visits and meds for us and 3 kids 

you could triple my income tax to pay for and id still come out with more takehome pay"
AskReddit,thank you for this based on comments i see regularly on here i think many europeans are under the impression that most americans are opposed to universal health care and were basically idiots doing this to ourselves in fact a solid majority is in favor of it but we cant get around the broken system or overcome the moneyed interests arrayed against us
AskReddit,the majority of jobs dont even have retirement plans these days
AskReddit,even the shareholders may or may not benefit  if the shares dont pay dividends and the shareholder isnt holding the stock for years they may or may not get anything out of holding shares in a healthcare company
AskReddit,"i live outside the us i dont make much and i pay plenty of taxes we have universal healthcare i add supplemental insurance through my hmo and i have private insurance which if i needed it will fly me and another person to the usa board us cover the treatment and the hospital stay bring us back and pay disability while i cant work all this with a max copay of about 250 this covers me my wife and my kid

including the healthcare taxes the supplemental insurance and the private insurance i pay less than 700 a month

the us system is broken it doesnt have to be but too many people between you and good healthcare make their living off it being broken"
AskReddit,fellow aussie here my dad needed to get emergency brain surgery last year i looked it up and his surgery wouldve cost 70k in the us here the surgery physio and recovery equipment were all free
AskReddit,and it literally works in every other first world country

edit i should also mention that all emergency care is free so if youre visiting dont hesitate to go to ae er if you need to"
AskReddit,deleted
AskReddit,speaks to the culture weve created about going to the doctor ive seen people sprint from ambulances that were passed out cold an hour earlier the costs terrify folks
AskReddit,except many jobs are moving to gig economy hiring part time workers without benefits anyway and leaving people uninsured so those who do have insurance through work feel extra trapped
AskReddit,198m jesus christ the cost of healthcare in america will always shock me i genuinely cannot fathom it how could any normal person ever pay that much
AskReddit,the 198 is the sticker price they have inflated sticker prices and then secret negotiated rates w different insurances for the actual price to be paid the inflated sticker price bullshit needs to be made illegal asap hospitals are not a fucking retail store they shouldnt be allowed to fuck around like an old navy putting out a high price to trick insurances into agreeing to the sale price as a good deal
AskReddit,this happened to me except it was for a bone marrow transplant my oncologist said that every day mattered with this very aggressive cancer but the bmt team wouldnt begin until the money was accounted for i was delayed about six weeks enough time for the disease to progress to my liver i had several complications including a stroke i was 25 and i have lasting disability from treatment everyday i wonder if those six weeks wouldve made a difference
AskReddit,i had a 3cm stomach ulcer and my doctor prescribed nexium insurance denied it because it was officially for repairing the esophagus for esophageal reflux  my doctors office had to call and explain to the insurance company that they could pay for medicine or stomach surgery i got the pills and they healed my ulcer  that stuff it otc now
AskReddit,"slightly less dire in my circumstance but im on antidepressants have been for years every year my doctor and therapist both agree its working and i should stay on it and it keeps my swings in check my insurance company will not ever ever cover a 90 day prescription only 30 days 90 day out of pocket cost is 450 i moved to europe same medication for 90 days is 37 out of pocket

how the fuck can bean counters override the medical recommendations of two medical professionals is beyond me"
AskReddit,one of my colleagues collapsed at work the emts asked for her insurance card and had me rifle through her purse while she was receiving treatment on the floor i was disgusted
AskReddit,"these stories break my heart

i could write a novel on how obscene the authorization process is this applies to both preauthorizations for scheduled andor elective services and concurrent authorizations for emergency stays the former can have significant repercussions for the patient especially when its a conditionsituation where time is of the essence the latter can have devastating impacts on a hospitals finances 

we once had a case where a patient came in with severe rectal bleeding among other issues patient was admitted and while inhouse diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic liver cancer our claim to the health plan was denied because the patients stay was not medically necessary"
AskReddit,"my son was diagnosed with a very rare heart defect in his preteen years he was diagnosed because of a severe health event while playing sports and over the next few months we learned that his condition would be fatal if he did not have his heart repaired through open heart surgery

the heart condition was so rare and my son has a bleeding disorder so it was very complicated as well that there were only a handful of hospitals throughout the country that could perform it my insurance an expensive high quality insurance that i have held for more than a decade denied the surgery for months because they would only cover it if it could be performed locally which it could not  the hospital would only schedule the surgery if i could pay 30000 up front because of the insurance companys reluctance

so in a matter of months my son almost died i learned he had a fatal condition i had to travel through country to find someone who could treat him and then i had to come up with 30000 while on leave from work and staying in a hotel away from my friends and family to even have a chance at saving his life

in the end we bargained the hospital down to accepting 10000 up front my son had the surgery and we are still fighting with the insurance company to pay their share to this day

our healthcare system is fucked and the only people who dont realize that are the ones who havent suffered a major medical problem  yet"
AskReddit,dont forget that even if you ask for the price on what something costs or what you will owe they many times will not be able to tell you even if you tell them the hospital doctor operation etc and if anything in the process is not covered you wont find out many times until after
AskReddit,amen
AskReddit,what are the things you saw that made you change you change your mind
AskReddit,id like to understand why you were neutral to begin with
AskReddit,just the fact that you need to make a decision while having a fucking head injury its mental
AskReddit,a head injury with blackouts ct should have been the highest priority whats the point in insurance if it doesnt cover a very predictable and essential piece of treatment
AskReddit,canadian here and i can confirm we have private doctors and labs that arent tax funded but big hospitals provide universal healthcare as long as you have a government issues healthcard that is
AskReddit,"most cancer treatments will be over 100000 for mild ones that are internal on the high end ive seen 253m in bills from cancer and thats with insurance


edit this gained a shit ton of traction i should specify many insurances are very different and have different clauses in them some modify maximum out of pocket some have limits to how much they cover others are barely any type of insurance and are just there to appeast the powers that be in order to hire full time these things are subjective

if youre reading this check your own insurance some will cover everything some have a minimum copay others will have a maximum allowed coverage and anything after that falls on the shoulders of the patient they are all different from each state each job and every person policies vary its important to know yours"
AskReddit,"i had testicular cancer  2 surgeries and 2 weeks of chemotherapy i only had to pay 10 euro per day for staying in the hospital i am german

i asked my insurance to show me all cancer related costs it was around 20k in total which i found surprisingly low considering 2 surgeries alone no idea if some other government program payed other parts of the treatment"
AskReddit,"my cancer surgeries totalled up to half a million between them

fortunately im a software engineer so i have amazing insurance  my total out of pocket was 1500  two years out of pocket maximums"
AskReddit,this i got in debt over my head in my 20s digging out took more than 7 years but but i got by all right not having credit available for that time
AskReddit,i literally lack the neural connections to process the fact that americans think that this is an okay situation to let happen
AskReddit,iirc its because when corporations were tearing down unions they used healthcare as an incentive rather than install universal healthcare then 70 years ago lawmakers didnt  likely because they got their pockets lined with cash from insurance companies
AskReddit,"i had some weird symptoms nerve pain laggy leg other stuff er doctor tried to tell me it was sciatica it was not i was in my 20s my primary doctor sent me to a neurologist who ordered an mri because of the misdiagnosis the mri was rejected by medicaid  no prior authorization i appealed and won my appeal but the process took so long the mri found nothing of note

seven years and a lot of other weird things and periods spent with no medical care due to no insurancei was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis diagnosing neurologist looking at my brain scans telling me i have a lot of lesions i have the relapsingremitting type so it was years of symptoms nothing weird things nothing

i have permanent symptoms now though"
AskReddit,"people always bring up wait times in countries with universal healthcare

to add on to this the longer wait times argument is doubly ridiculous because there are plenty of countries with universal healthcare and short wait times"
AskReddit,yeah dude american healthcare literally costs an arm and a leg
AskReddit,what country was this
AskReddit,may want to go to the pt once and ask for a home exercise program or at least look up a rehab protocol for your injury i rehab people for a living and look up other peoples protocols all the time to spur ideas
AskReddit,the dr may have delayed the mri due to potential swelling that could impede the imaging itself i dont know enough about mris but its a valid concern wouldnt want to go in there get an mri done and then have to go do another one because they couldnt accurately read the first one
AskReddit,my gastro doctors youngest patient to die from colon cancer was a 16 yo girl  if you cant get a doctor to diagnose your issues go to the er they will find out what is going on  my dad died of colon cancer  he went to his regular doctor but she thought he had pulled a muscle a little over two weeks later he drove himself to the er at 6 am and by 10 am after a ct scan we knew he had a large mass in his abdomen and the next day we found out he had colon cancer  with the symptoms you are experiencing go to the er
AskReddit,"you cant get a colonoscopy because youre too young what kind of bullshit is that i had a colonoscopy when i was 31 and another when i was 35 neither one of them were my idea the first one was because i had a fistula and the second one was due to some concerning rectal bleeding that just turned out to be big fat internal hemhorroids 

i feel so bad for americans man one of my best friends lives in ny state and i worry about her if she were ever to break her leg or something "
AskReddit,have you demanded a colonoscopy ive heard that helps also if they refuse to do any test have them write down that theyre refusing to do so heard that helps also
AskReddit,con confirm that ut state employees are literally encouraged to fly to canada and mexico i also have family members that regularly trek up north for antidepressants because the prices on basic drugs in this country are suicideworthy its time to stop wasting lives with voting and start smacking dollars out of politicians like the inept piatas that they are the lives of my family are worth far more than theirs and so are yours stop turning the other cheek just to die of preventable maladies
AskReddit,not op but if im too poor for insurance im too poor for a trip to mexico
AskReddit,in other countries as well you get some health insurance from your job it is just that the universal one is comprehensive enough that it doesnt matter as much
AskReddit,"hell also go the way of abe lincoln and jfk sadly
prob part of the reason no ones trying it"
AskReddit,"insurance in the us is usually tied to a job if its offered its usually too expensive to just pay for insurance yourself so you get whatever insurance the job offers

problem every insurance company has a million plans and theres countless insurance companies too each plan supports different doctors they specifically have a system where a doctor may or may not be approved for certain plans sometimes doc john is approved sometimes hes not sometimes doc steve is approved sometimes not sometimes both sometimes neither this is all highly variable

if you go to a doctor who is not covered you either get vastly reduced coverage or no coverage at all and have to pay largely or completely out of pocket most people dont have the money to deal with the lack of coverage

so if youre at job a with insurance a plan a you go to doc a because thats the one who is available to you

switch to job b because of a better offer or because you lost the old job or whatever now youre on insurance b plan b and doc b because you cant afford to go to doc a anymore because hes not covered

switch to job c insurance c plan c maybe you get lucky and one of the previous doctors is available

probably not though"
AskReddit,my former roommate went to get his prescription filled and she gave him the price she then said she forgot to apply his insurance after applying his out of pocket portion was more than buying his meds outright it was cheaper for him to not use his insurance that he pays for every month
AskReddit,yeah i just posted basically that  ive talked to my providers about this because ive had to deal with some of that shit and from every one of them ive heard that the price insurance companies see is absolutely not what you should be paying and often talking to the provider whether its your dentist or a billing department of a hospital is a really good way to cut down on what youre paying to them especially if insurance wont cover it at all
AskReddit,we dont somewhere around 65 of all personal bankruptcies are due to medical debt its terrible over here but we allow lobbying bribery in our government so laws are written benefiting the highest bidder which is always going to be a corporation
AskReddit,being dutch i agree not having free healthcare sounds almost like eugenics to me
AskReddit,"honestly just do what we do and charge  deduct a small amount of tax per month that goes to us healthcare

the nhs might not be the best in the world but im 100000 glad we have this structure in place and the people who work in healthcare youre something else i tell ya well done"
AskReddit,we have the best politicians corporate money can buy they are dug in like ticks and we cant get them out so we try to live with it
AskReddit,"i was offered the chance to abort but there was nothing solid about my sons condition his brain looked good but his kidneys were bad his heart was good but his lungs were bad his size was good but there was no amniotic fluid 

in the end i made the decision to deliver but it was my choice 

my body went through hell and i had to deliver via a c section the scar still gives me random pain six years later 

no one should have to be pregnant if they do not want to be pregnant"
AskReddit,you forget that american healthcare is a business they spend lots of money lobbying to keep insurance a ncessity because they all make more money that way
AskReddit,"its worth it in the end 

people are afraid of losing their jobs because losing their insurance could literally kill them they can wave that threat around and get people to do whatever they want"
AskReddit,that all sounded like a terrifying amount of money until you said melbourne
AskReddit,"death or debt ultimatums are very real here ive personally been involved in a few for myself or others in the us its not uncommon for ppl to suffer potentially life threatening injuries like my mom got drunk and full blown tripped face first into a stone hearth and had massive bruising on her face and decide they dont want to risk the bill theyd rather risk death then have suffer even the possibility that the trip wasnt worth it

my disease causes some pretty extreme heart and motor problems i have severe dysautonomia and my vitals can get extremely unstable also have something called paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia thats basically a descriptive diagnosis for episodes of uncontrollable violent flailing that can last hours

i have my own ecg machine not even joking thats so that if i have an episode i can take my own ecg and decide whether to go to the er bought a freaking textbook so i could interpret the damn thing had an episode where my heart rate was up to 170 beats a minute i had severe st depressions chest pain dizziness and my oxygen was tanking and i waited a couple hours to see if it would go away thankfully it did the nearest hospital was over an hour away ppl should feel comfortable seeking health care when symptoms are that bad

the one time i did call an ambulance i had been flailing on the bathroom floor for 5 solid hours after a heart and digestive episode triggered a motor episode i had ripped off all my clothes cuz i cant control my temperature when that happens so i cycle between really hot and really cold i lost control of my bowels and defecated on myself and had already collected 60 or so bruises from slamming against the walls and toilet

they got me out somehow i blew outa both ends in the ambulance nearly throttled the emt because the only thing i can control is my hands so i grip stuff they needed me to loosen my grip on the rail to get an iv and my hand snapped right into their scrubs and i locked up again exploded the iv in my arm requested restraints for myself then broke them all 

they wheeled me into the er naked and covered in puke and crap and it took them another 5 hours of giving me iv ativan anti nausea and pain meds to get it to stop enough to get a ct to make sure i hadnt ruptured my bowels

thats how bad it had to be to make me choose the ambulance my story isnt even that unique the ambulance ride alone was 15k i didnt even bother opening the hospital bill i cant pay that off even a healthy person capable of working couldnt its gunna sit there in collections forever"

AskReddit,we have damn good hospitals here just not many
AskReddit,"100 this my partner came off a quad bike at work and couldnt stand up his colleagues called the local ambulance they came gave him meds and assessed him the called the westpac helicopter and he was airlifted to newcastle hospital  a 1 hour drive from where he works he was in hospital for 11 days on constant medication multiple xrays cts and i think also an mri before spinal surgery





what did it cost us nothing 




i remember when i was younger wanting to move to america as an adult i think ill stay in australia




eta i suppose you could say the cost was 50 for his yearly ambulance cover the actual bill we received before submitting his private health was still only 1000 for an ambulance that ended up requiring a helicopter"
AskReddit,"yeah exactly i had unexplained abdominal pain one morning went to my gp who suggested appendicitis and was told to head to royal perth emergency room around 8 hours later i was in a bed talked to two doctors had a sonogram of my guts had a third doctor assess the sonogram and tell me its probably not appendicitis but to be 100 safe theyre keeping me overnight and hungry because if it did end up being appendicitis they wanted to operate asap so it didnt rupture and end up being a much bigger problem 

in the morning theyd decided it wasnt appendicitis and my total cost for the visit was 20 to get the anti inflammation meds they prescribed at my local pharmacy 

i love medicare"
AskReddit,note to self if in finland only get stabbed in the wilderness
AskReddit,"i broke my leg on a mountain not even that remote but i was on a trail impossible to reach with vehicles

they sent a helicopter with 6 people between pilot firefighters and a doctor and a team on foot just in case i was transported at the hospital and given xrays and a cast

total bill 0

for the next 2 appointments additional xrays and a modification on the cast to start putting weight on my foot i payed around 40 

edit i am in italy"

AskReddit,we dont pay at point of access to health care in the uk you can call an ambulance any number of times and still not pay anything its all paid for in national insurance payments from your salary pre tax
AskReddit,if you want to ruin an americans day beat them up if you want to ruin their life beat them up and then call them an ambulance
AskReddit,a conservative would tell you that the sensible solution would be to sue your attacker because spending years in court only to be paid out ten bucks a month for eighty years
AskReddit,"you probably need to qualify the bit about private hospitals

the vast majority are small outfits that do routine stuff like appendix pacemakers hips etc

if you need something major such as a heart transplant its going to almost always happen in the public system obviously places like st vincents private is a cut above and similar in other states most large private hospitals have a public hospital attached and the usually dont have ae

serious complications are mostly dealt with in the public system"
AskReddit," see i try to understand the american psyche and reasoning for not wanting universal health care and i fail at it

let me see if i can help its similar to our attitudes about poverty unless im in that situation i dont believe i will be in that situation so fuck helping them if i am partly in that situation eg crappy insurance with big deductibles and shitty coverage maxing at 80 of the bill or struggling to get by with 2 jobs then i know its rough but i think its on me because i buy into the  rugged individual attitudes we all have and if i am truly in the situation there is a 5050 chance i think how fucked we are vs thinking the system should do a better job but the utter failure of most americans to have basic empathy means my opinions dont matter

its like a thing i saw recently floating on facebook illustrated american social values  the person who takes 3 slices of pizza because hes afraid it will run out is motivated by the same belief as the person who takes only 1"
AskReddit,"the top arguments against most of them are deeply flawed


1 its socialism for a large number of people this is enough to make them fear it the red scare propaganda with deep roots from the cold war still has a lot of sway especially with the older generation


2 itll raise taxes


3 quality of care will decline and wait times with lengthen



4 apparently some people really like their insurance or are afraid they wont be able to see their chosen doctor fear of change probably




honestly i just dont think americans are well informed enough to make an educated decision on the topic im american but im constantly surprised by how little other americans know about the outside world its pretty common to be in a political discussion with another american where theyre telling me soandso system is impossible and itll never work and i just have the be likeyou mean like in these 30 countries that already do soandso then they just give you a blank stare"
AskReddit,"the biggest bill you get in australia is to park at the hospital
i have a combination of things that make my pregnancies crazy high risk was told i had to go public because the best nicus are there and free i was in the hospital 23 days a week being monitored had a huge team of different specialists to see weekly had an emergency caesarian complications after birth

we paid 9 day to park at the hospital that was it so so grateful for our healthcare system"
AskReddit,i survived and had almost 300000 in debt after insurance paid for 66 of everything
AskReddit,"yeah if you get cancer in the ushttpswwwnprorgsectionshealthshots20190226696321475cancercomplicationsconfusingbillsmaddeningerrorsandendlessphonecalls youve got a 42 chance of draining your life savings to pay for treatment and are 265 times more likely to file for bankruptcy than people who dont get cancer 

basically we have a halfassed system cobbled together from popsicle sticks and wet paper towels in the 1950s plus a culture based on a bizarre and cruel interpretation of the protestant work ethic that says if you really want to improve your life youll just pull yourself up by your bootstraps and if you or a loved one gets cancer well sucks to be you clearly you should have planned better and not gotten cancer

i am currently accepting applications from eu citizens for platonic marriages all genders welcome i can cook walk dogs and write bad poetry"
AskReddit,expensive cancer is my personal do everything youve always wanted to your life is over anyways card
AskReddit,the sad truth is many people will forego treatment due to its cost even if its only mildly life threatening it can bankrupt you theres no st judes for adults either
AskReddit,i had cancer i ended up with about 375k in bills before insurance paid all of it except my deductible then i wrote a letter into the hospital with an application for charity to have the cost covered and thankfully they covered it all
AskReddit,"edited since poster above me was a prankster
his original post was as a brit i cannot fathom how you yanks are ok with this he refered to the cost of health care

me neither as a norwegian i pay tax that covers healthcare"
AskReddit,"i live in germany as well but had a similar experience as your friend this is more for the you wont get any appointments in time anymore kind of people because i hear this argument a lot
thought i felt a lump in one of my testicles went to the doc and told them about my issue and they immediately offered me to stay the receptionist told me they dont take new patients at the moment but the doctor has a policy to see anyone right away who thinks they might have a bigger issue like cancer because hed rather see too many who have nothing than miss one who has something and the checkup only takes like 5 minutes anyways

anyways it wasnt cancer and i was out of there in less than 20 minutes of course not costing me anything more than my usual monthly public insurance payment"
AskReddit,"when i was about 8 months pregnant i stopped being able to feel my daughter move  i drank oj sat down moved around ate some sugar and no movement  my husband brought me to my dr  they did an ultrasound and stress test she was fine she had just gotten too big to have space to move around

had to pay 2500"
AskReddit,"australia here my glass shower door unexpectedly shattered a few years ago and i got a big deep gash on my calf that bled like an absolute bastard and definitely needed stitches yes i spent about four hours in the emergency ward which is never fun but i got examined cleaned up xrayed to make sure there was no glass inside the cut stitched and bandaged and sent home with an appointment for stitch removal a few weeks later and 0 out of pocket

what would that have been in the us for the uninsured a few hundred at least but the xray might have pushed it over a grand"
AskReddit,"many years ago i had just arrived in ireland on a temporary work visa  just a couple days after arriving i had a minor foot injury and went to the hospital  after i was treated i asked the doctor where i needed to go to sort out payment and what not  he asked me where i was from  i said i was american  he just said well youre european today  i didnt even have to sign anything on the way out  

in contrast shortly after i returned to the states a coworker of mine who hadnt been on the job long enough to qualify for insurance yet went to the er for what he thought was a possible heart attack ended up not being one but still  he later got a bill for about 800 dollars  being newly hired he had been without work for a while and didnt have a fallback fund so he called to ask for a payment plan  they informed him that what he received was only the first payment  in the end he had a five figure bill from one overnight in the erhospital

fuck the us healthcare system  we have the most expensive system in the industrialized world by a long shot with the worst careresults as well"
AskReddit,the fact that this is controversial or debatable makes me sad to be honest
AskReddit,"i just dont understand the health insurance via your employer thing

here australia we have universal healthcare all paid for through taxes so that covers you for free for immediate attention for any life threatening accident or illness like my mum had bowel cancer so all her chemo was free and her bowel surgery etc in a public hospital if its not life threatening then you may have a wait but you would get it  length of wait depends on how the severity for that condition is graded

but we also have the option to take out private health insurance which depending on level of cover you choose allows you to get non emergency treatment faster in a private hospital and you can choose your doctor sugeon etc level of cover you choose determines basically what your out of pocket expenses would look like for the private treatment 

but why any of this would be tied to your employment status or who your employer is is the bit that baffles me what happens when you retire for example"
AskReddit,thats not europe thats most of the world
AskReddit,"im worried this will spoil the kids

AskReddit,"the first time i had to go to the hospital on my own in canada i was about 19 i had a cyst on my face near my eye that got infected and started growing overnight into something fairly massive 

i got to the emergency and they saw the obvious problem in the middle of my face i was told to go to the waiting room they checked my insurance card and it wasnt renewed they told me to get that fixed asap but that didnt really matter

took about 20 minutes to be called into minor surgery and they took care of me right away someone ended up coming to bandage my wound and tell me that i could go so i walked back to the front desk and asked if i needed to pay anything get some sort of insurance receipt or something like that they looked at me fairly puzzled and just told me to leave i was in and out in roughly 45 minutes didnt pay a dime and they didnt even bother giving me a paper trail despite my insurance not being fully up to date

a lightning fast would cyst again"
AskReddit,to be clear its socialized not socialist  the two are quite different
AskReddit,"even with insurance he has to pay 200 a month for insulin in sweden hed only have to pay roughly 275 a year because thats the maximum you have to pay in a 12 month period for prescription medicine that is ruled necessary

in the uk that would be entirely free even the normal nominal 935 prescription charge is waived if you have a longterm condition like diabetes"
AskReddit,"when i was 19 i had to go through jaw surgery it required braces and orthodontic care for a year prior  half a year after the op a 5 hour surgery so complicated only 5 or 6 surgeons in the country could do it a stay for one day on intensive care and 2 days stay in a regular hospital room plus consultations and after care from the surgeon of course 

my parents had the better insurance that covered some extra which would be around 150  200 monthly i think its over 10 years ago could be more or less i am dutch we work with insurance cover for nationalised healthcare so that insurance covered all of the above and we didnt have to pay a penny 

if i was american i would still have the same jaw condition i could live with it so in the us i would have just sucked it up and never addressed it"
AskReddit,canada doesnt event have socialized prescription drug coverage broadly speaking the provinces negotiate the prices of all prescription drugs on behalf of canadians you paid full price thats something america could start doing day 1 without invoking the s word
AskReddit,the american system is good for one thing it provides really good care if youre rich billionaires from other countries fly into mass general and so on not that that helps normal people
AskReddit,jobs alone are never an argument
AskReddit,theres like 8 other types of insurance it wouldnt even be that hard to switch to selling a different type

AskReddit,this is me for years on medicaid with no desire to move up because with kids  wife and i skirt around it on the line for years cuz 1 step up we lose it  was hard enough losing stamps  and people wonder why the down stay down
AskReddit,"im a canadian who used to work in the healthcare industry in the distribution of hospital supplies i knew exactly what each thing costs down to a single cotton ball while in the us once i was hospitalized and the itemized bill they gave me was robbery 

meanwhile in canada ive been sick and injured so many times ive lost count of how many hospital stays ive had as well as several major surgeries ive never paid a single penny for any of it"
AskReddit,"it did changehttpswwwnytimescominteractive20210822upshothospitalpriceshtml hospitals legally have to post all of the cost of services in the us now since jan 1st 2021

AskReddit,"german here we almostall pay 14 of our income thats a lot but since everyone pays it its a regular part of how we calculate wages theres a huge mental benefit in knowing that youll always have healthcare even if you lose your job 

my partner regularly gets out more than he pays into the sxstem he needs humira and his copay is 5 every 6 months"
AskReddit,the argument against it is funded by the people who would stand to lose the most money if no one needed them anymore its amazing to me how effective their propaganda has been in getting people to fight against their own best interests
AskReddit,you left out the best part the employers contribution goes buhbye its no longer their concern this would be a corporate windfall but the people running the show are too fucking stupid to get this im so frustrated at the lack of leadership vision and corruption here
AskReddit," and whats the point of insurance if they dont do their job which is to pay out when something does happen

lining the pockets of the parasitic middle man thats the point"
AskReddit,i had a heart attack a year ago us citizen and now ill be paying off 160000 for the rest of my life would have been cheaper to die
AskReddit,i broke my shoulder while pregnant a few years ago and the cost for the er visit was 4k out of pocketit was 7k total before insurance paid but my max out of pocket was 4k so i had to pay that best part they didnt do much i got a xray a arm sling ultrasound and was monitored overnight due to being pregnant and falling oh and on top of that my insurance coverage cost 800 a month yay for living the us
AskReddit,wow with health insurance i still had to pay about 100 for a routine blood test at my yearly check up only to be told i need to take a little more vitamin d the healthcare system in america is criminal and anyone who supports such a system baffle me
AskReddit,american here pray really hard
AskReddit,given how the americans ive personally talked to is baffled that we dont have firearms in denmark because we wouldnt be able to overthrow our government should it come to it im very surprised yall havent overthrown your own government yet
AskReddit,"in the netherlands its a tad more expensive still i pay about 90 eur a month for insurance and if i land in the hospital the deductable is high 835 eur but then im completely out of the woods and the insurance will cover the rest

dental isnt included by default but i opted for the 5 eur premium a month checkups are on me so about 40 eur a year but as soon as a tooth needs pulling or cavities filled the dental plan covers it

there are plenty of choices in insurance companies but you get to choose and they cant kick you out for costing too much only if you dont pay the monthly fee

its not free universal healthcare but id say its a pretty safe setup and a lot better than the train wreck in the us"
AskReddit,"as an american who moved to the uk a few years ago i agree with all of this the peace of mind of not having your healthcare tied to your job and having little to no profit motive for healthcare providers is invaluable 

also you probably dont pay more in taxes the top tax rate is lower in the us but for most regular people its similar to european countries its hard to compare any given individuals since each state has different tax rules but as someone making about 50 above the average salary in each country my taxes havent really changed but i get so much more from the government its only the wealthy who pay less in the us"
AskReddit,which is the stupidest fucking thing ive ever heard because what the fuck do they think their insurance money goes to they dont keep it in a specific little lock box just for you theyre already paying for everyone elses healthcare anyway the only difference is the method
AskReddit,"the irony of this argument is that in the us you still have to wait to get appointments sometimes even for life threatening things

i was diagnosed with ms this year during an er visit and it was progressing rapidly okay great lets get on something to hopefully help stall that nope i then had to wait three weeks because their nuero was busy then i had to wait another three weeks for insurance to approve the treatment plan thankfully nothing happened in that time but thats still a six week wait for something that could have resulted in disability progression in that time 

im still convinced anyone against universal healthcare has never actually had to use our healthcare system or theyre profiting off the current model"
AskReddit, honestly i never thought it that way its much easier to fall into a scam when the real treatment could bankrupt you
AskReddit,"thats fascinating i didnt know that any idea how the nhs calculates costs 

ive worked in the nhs for 15 years and obviously the notion of healthcare costing money has never come up"
AskReddit,"i got mrsa very drugresistant staph infection on my calf the day before i flew to london for work by 2 days into my trip it was obvious something was wrong so i went to hospital they diagnosed the problem and tried treating it in 3 separate hospital trips they photocopied my passport but never asked for any payment that was in 2018

in fairness they also didnt cure it apparently mrsa is a north american thing i flew home and had my infection surgically cut open and left open to slowly heal over a month i have a nasty scar but i lived

yes universal healthcare would be nice"
AskReddit,"lol unfortunately the math still checks out 150 of 30k is still only 45k less than 14 of the 200k bill

healthcare here in america is terrible but weve been labeled socialists and shunned by friends for supporting it

my dad chose to drive himself to a hospital after having a heart attack and again after cutting off multiple fingers with a table saw

my husband and i were charged 6k for a less than 5 minute ride in an ambulance"
AskReddit,its the same in canada but you would still come out ahead
AskReddit,dont usevthe nhs then private cost of bupa code 1800 and 3 night stay youd be looking at about 5000 in a private hospital in london another couple of grand for flights accommodation and another couple if you wanted to stay for 2 weeks to make sure it healed and opd dressings lets say 10k sterling all in allow 50 for unknowns youd still have change from 10 of what op spent

AskReddit,"they cant  my dad survived a 3month coma in 2017 uninsured  left with a 900k bill  i spent 3 months sunctioning his trach hole  playing his favorite music to watch him survive recover amazingly well in physicalcognitive rehab move into a house  get his drivers license back and still die almost exactly 2 years after he woke up  

my dad had been crippled by ra for decades  he never wanted to take from others  viewed social services as being for people with more needs than him women children disabled people etc  dad was stubborn as hell so in a way it felt like he kinda went out on his own terms by not accepting or trying to receive help

leading up to my dads death he could no longer afford his heart medication  i knew he was bad shape  i knew he was worse off than he was letting on  hed always thank me for making him laugh our last few conversations  the last weekend i texted him asking asking to borrow his truck to go haul some free river rock  no reply  then nothing over a fridaysunday  at the very minimum hed have simply told me no if that was the answer which would have still been unlikely  im the one people ask to tetrisstyle park vehicles  trust to make runs in their trucks  dad always got back to me about needsbased questions quickly  by sunday i was expecting bad news  when people i love die i can feel it  it felt like he couldnt let me borrow his truck as strange as that probably sounds

a couple days later what i didnt expect to find was a recent medicaid denial letter while cleaning dads house after he died of a heart attack  that broke me  i howled like an animal crying was not enough  im  not much of cryer  the one time my dad asked for help as a 635 year old anoxic brain injury survivor with crippling ra seizures  heart issues  he was denied  not disabled or over 65

i dont know how to make universal healthcare work but our system is so superfluously broken  nobody should have to find a letter like that cleaning up their dead relatives house after their loved one dies of a manageable medical condition because their state decided they werent over 65 or disabled  had he survived a bit longer he would have been able to enroll in expanded medicaid  now my dead dads sign up for medicare plan b type mail all comes to my house because im the only offspring with his last name  i hate this countrys healthcare so much

AskReddit,and getting the treatment sooner could have avoided the complications and long term health issues so would have been cheaper  better for you better for whoever is paying the bill  but not done because so much bureaucracy goes into trying not to pay or at least making sure all the rules and various plan details are followed  its not a good or efficient system

AskReddit,oh my gosh ive been on the same adhd meds for years and i cannot tell you how many times i have had to go without it because the insurance company would bitch about how i didnt try certain other medications first despite my doctors sending proof that i did this has happened countless times shouldnt one time be enough and sure we can pay out of pocket but insurance saves us at least a hundred bucks and not to mention all of the other medications im on for various health issues people cry that universal healthcare  communism1 but id rather people not have to struggle through unbelievable stress because they cant afford something that will save their life call me crazy and that may sound dramatic but there are plenty of stories here from people who have literally been through this exact situation so yeah

AskReddit,prescriptions are free in scotland
AskReddit,i was working the front desk at an urgent care guy walks in says im having a heart attack and drops to his knees i hit the panic button on the wall and the staff came and took him back later that day my boss called me into her office and reprimanded me for not getting his id and insurance info first
AskReddit,thats probably so they know what hospital to take her to  hmos prefer to treat inhouse though they cover emergency care received elsewhere and then seek to transfer you as soon as they safely can
AskReddit,"i used to work in employer benefits and we had a patient advocacy service where we tried to fix billing issues for patients mostly arguing about billing errors i had to fight with about 6 people over countless phone calls that the care our dude was getting was really an emergency because he was literally dying at the time 

i saved him something like 2000 and the rest of the issues he had with the claims on that particular er visithospital stay got cleared up at the end of that last argument 

when he started crying on the phone as i explained i broke down like a baby hed barely survived and the stress of the bills was eating at his family you saved us still haunts me under no circumstances in a civil society should my job have even existed he never should have had to worry about paying anything after having to fight to live"
AskReddit,blows my mind that insurance companies can make calls on whats medically necessary thats the doctors call and if it werent medically necessary they wouldnt admit the patient
AskReddit,"lack of exposure to the medicalindustrial complex i never had a serious issue except once when i was 18 most of my change came from working in the healthcare industry where i actually got to take a personal and intimate look at how the system works

it always comes down to education if they teach this stuff in high school wed probably have uhc already theres no way people would accept the system asis if they knew how it worked on the inside out amongst other things"
AskReddit,"yeah luckily i was with friends who forced me to go to the hospital they drove me despite one of them working crazy hours at the time and having  just gotten home late needing to head back out early in the morning seriously guardian angels both of them because i kept saying i was fine and just needed a bandaid lol this even through at least 3 blackouts i can remember as i walked the half block between where the accident occurred and their home where i was headed with one of them id been in the us for nearly a decade at that point and had successfully avoided an er visit on american soil i was and continue to be terrified of the financial ruin one could hand me

they obviously made the right choice for me and hey they even saved me the ambulance cost the gaps in the american social care systems are so often filled by the individuals one can surround themselves with and im incredibly lucky i just happened to be hanging out with these particular friends two of my closest in the world and two people with good heads on their shoulders who live on the opposite side of the country as me i know that the chances of this sort of thing happening to me under circumstances where i didnt have people who love me and even can take on temporary caretaker roles are much higher than the lucky circumstances i found myself in that night if thats true for me i can only imagine how many gaps cannot be and are not filled by peoples personal support systems in this country i cant repeat it enough i was so lucky and so privileged to have what i did available to me in that emergency including of course the insurance i could afford to pay for and even more so the savings that took the hit for the costs of the ct scan

the individualistic selfishness that powers the american machine breaks my heart to think about i survived it on this occasion but so many simply cant"
AskReddit,whats the point capitalism baby
AskReddit,jesus fcking christ thats highway robbery and way overpriced i knew things were bad in america but i didnt know they were literally extorting people pay us 3 million or you die thats horrible
AskReddit,"2 mil holy cow thats outrageous 
2 mil is around  14cr here no way someone can pay that much

 100000 is what youll have to pay in a private hospital in my country"
AskReddit,pretty sure most dont there is a systematic effort to neutralize politicians who are serious about fixing it though the situation is so intractable with so much money on the line that i dont think well ever see it solved without an unprecedented degree of political will
AskReddit,"youre doctor ordered an mri and it was rejected by who  how is that even a thing

i mean if my doctorcanada puts in for an mri for me ill be getting an mri  either in a couple days or maybe a month or two depending on the priority level set for the scan  

sauce have had literally dozens of mris and ongoing get a couple regularly scheduled every year now  has never cost a dime

in before someone else says you do pay in taxes

ive done the math elsewhere but in short family of 4 80k a year income when i worked it out  taking my total tax burden income tax  sales tax on my remaining net income and the percentage of tax dollars that go to healthcare i pay 2400year in total for end to end healthcare for all four of us with not even a concept of billing let alone deductibles co pays and other such shit

so sure i do pay but show me a us based insurance plan that would cover a family of 4 to that extent with no deductibles or networks or such shit  and employer paid insurance is still out of your pocket they have a budget for staff and the cost of the insurance provided comes from that budget every bit as much as wages do"
AskReddit,i hear that im sorry for your diagnosis i have rrms as well kinda fucking sucks
AskReddit,"there are also plenty of countries with mixed systems

im currently in australia which is a mix of universal healthcare and mandatory heavily incentivise private insurance for above a certain income level

our system is stretched but my wife needed an mri on private insurance last year and from memory it cost less than 100 out of pocket was done the next day and it certainly will not have increased our premiums this year

a couple of months back i ended up being an inpatient for 4 days for iv antibiotics and a minor but urgent procedure  i could have chosen to use my private insurance which ive already paid for or go public i went public as id have had to pay several hundred in out of pocket expenses in private my total cost for 4 nights as a inpatient was 0 but i had to pay 15 for oral antibiotics on leaving

all the private insurance is good for is speeding up elective surgery and covering ambulances id much rather get rid of it and increase funding to the public option"
AskReddit,"people that have been convinced to not want universal healthcare only want universal healthcare when they or someone they know personally needs it 

gop convincing people to go against their best interest falls apart usually not always when the effects of it are right in front of them"
AskReddit,australia i just found out about a pars defect in one of my vertebrae and have had 56 doctor visits an xray ct scan and 5 physio visits for 0 total
AskReddit,hospitals wont do it because insurance wont pay for it unless youre 50 or have demonstrated family history
AskReddit,doc one of us is getting something shoved up their ass before i leave this office  now do you want to perform the colonoscopy or are we going with door number 2
AskReddit,"how does that work when you come here to canada for medical care i imagine you pay the going rate for medications but if you go to the doctor or seek treatment do they bill you

i cant imagine having to pay for medical care"
AskReddit,deleted
AskReddit,"in australia virtually nobody gets health insurance from our jobs we are encouraged theres an additional tax on income earners above a certain threshold who dont do so to buy private health insurance individually for oneself or oneself plus ones family partner and kids under the age of 26 so that there is less demand for the universal healthcare system ive had an mri a few ct scans had broken bones fixed went to er got xrayed and got a cast on my hand while paying 000 without paying a cent

edit just to be clear the treatments i described were after i turned 26 and therefore had no health insurance and im still too poor as a graduate student to be able to afford private insurance"
AskReddit,thanks for the reply i didnt quite understand how it worked and also that seems so complex is it common for people to stay in a terrible job just to keep insurance
AskReddit,deleted
AskReddit,now youre getting it
AskReddit,"everyone here is literally too stupid to understand that the tax would be less or the same as we spend on private insurance monthly already

its really that rich people dont want to pay a tax because theyll pay more automatically so they harness their vast media ownership to spread lies about public healthcare around every election bezos did it with washington post this last time"
AskReddit,im so glad you were given the option im sure the uncertainty was traumatizing i cant imagine your pain and having to recover from a csection on top of it allmy heart goes out to you
AskReddit,it is more like a scam that preys on the weak i have had bills that reduced in to half just because i asked for a breakdown of charges
AskReddit,"yes thank goodness for universal healthcare i wouldnt want to be making a decision about whether we could afford to get our daughter the help she needed

and we love the childrens with their enormous fish tank  the meerkat habitat that the kids can see the meerkats and the captain starlight room"
AskReddit,i was so stressed reading that until i saw not america thats crippling debt right there
AskReddit,"that is tragic and i sincerely hope you are not in that space again

everyone that works and earns above a certain amount pays the medicare levy the extra percentage i pay on top of my normal income tax and which percentage is staggered depending on how much you earn for me that is 3 this means everyone whether they work or not has free access to healthcare and hospital  and im more than happy to pay my levy because you never know when ill be the one with low or no income and i wouldnt want to be making decisions like you have to

now thats not to say for non emergency situations there may not be a bit of a wait but any situation like yours would jump immediately to the front of the queue and treatment would be free

and to have free ambulance travel anywhere as many times as required costs 80 per year"
AskReddit,"holy fck

seriously everytime i read anything about social security systems in the usa i just cant imagine how you can even live like that it seems in far too many cases you quite literally cant"
AskReddit,they certainly are i had flown down with our daughter in what i had on and seeing as we were going to be there for a few days they have an office that gives you a phone charger they have little toiletries and a place to shower and even give you clean knickers and tshirt 
AskReddit,so pretty much anywhere
AskReddit,we dont have many bears but the ones we have are real nasty
AskReddit,"that amount sounds soooo insane 

we have laws that dictate the deductible for ambulancetaxi rides for er cant cost more than 25 euros rest of the cost goes though kela a goverment ran facility"
AskReddit,"many years ago in college we had a student have a seizure  we called him an ambulance because nobody knew what else to do

dude came back to class next week  complaining he didnt need it and that thanks to us he had a huge 1500 bill now fucking america"
AskReddit,damnit you got a good laugh out of me lol
AskReddit,a conservative would tell you not to be a pussy and shoot the attacker they seem like cartoon goons at the eyes of europeans
AskReddit,"the absolutely crazy thing about us healthcare is how inefficient it is

im in the uk the nhs is free at the point of use for me for everything and saved my life recently after a bad accident

the nhs costs less per capita than medicaremedicaid

so i not only get all of my healthcare paid for i still pay less in healthcarerelated taxes than someone in the us does you can still get private healthcare here ive used it once to skip the queue and get an mri faster and private health insurance costs vastly less here than it does in the us because the assumption is that youll still use the nhs for most things"
AskReddit," after insurance paid for 66 of everything

this is what blows my mind  

you have to pay out a fair chunk every month for insurance   
that sucks but guess its not really any different to our nhs contributions   

oh but you also have to pay a deductible which can be in the thousands   
well that double sucks i can see why people are hesitant to phone an ambulance

and the insurance doesnt even cover your full bill   
i dont understand this system at all"
AskReddit,holy fucking shit serious after the insurance payed 66 too wtf how do you even pay back something like that ever you dont ofc damn
AskReddit,"the real issue is that the treatment cost 900000 total  that is absolutely mindblowingly ridiculous when compared the rest of the entire planet

healthcare will be broken no matter what until this issue is addressed  the government cant afford single payer healthcare at those prices  nobody can afford it  the prices need to come down"
AskReddit,republicans here dont comprehend this theyd consider this to be communism and say that we will end up like venezuela if we pass real health care theyre stupid
AskReddit,i would like to see where the fuck the americans supposedly getting their super fast appointments are b cause it sure as hell is not where i live
AskReddit,and if it was really cancer you might have caught it at an early stage and give you a far better chance at survival on a practical side it will cost the healthcare system far far less to catch cancer at an early stage
AskReddit,"800 dollars  being newly hired he had been without work for a while and didnt have a fallback fund so he called to ask for a payment plan  they informed him that what he received was only the first payment

at that moment in time i would pack my bags and leave the country 5 figure bill could be 5 years of income to me"
AskReddit,"so i recently had a hospital visit that involved a 100 mile medical helicopter flight a 10 hour spinal surgery a few ct scans about a dozen chest xrays a week in a high dependency unit and another week in a major trauma ward

it didnt cost me anything because i live in the civilised world but im trying to get a handle on just how bankrupt i would have been in the us i wonder what my bill would have been"
AskReddit,in ireland you have to pay for er and your gp its 100 for an ae visit last time i went im not sure how you got it for free
AskReddit,yeah our health service is imperfect in ireland and a trip to ae for something relatively minor like a blown out knee or a broken wrist or something can involve a decent wait time 4 or 5 hours mid week 10 hours weekend depending on severity in the ae waiting area but once youre into the system its great and most importantly free if needed you can get private healthcare here that can help you skip the queue for some things i got my tonsils out within a month of referral on private health insurance as a kid but had it been public it would have been 6 months but when it gets to the serious life threatening stuff there is no difference
AskReddit,"conservatives buy into the fear mongering bullshit about how universal healthcare will turn this country into a communist hellscape

their willful stupidity holds back progress"
AskReddit,post wwii the us had a low unemployment rate so companies started offering benefits like insurance to entice people to work for them that became the norm and insurance became the cluster fuck it is creating a wombo combo of shit
AskReddit,"i just dont understand the health insurance via your employer thing

disclosure  im not american from what i understand its not part of the law its really a bonus you get for working there many businesses dont give any kind of healthcare companies actually like it this way because it makes it harder for an employee to change jobs and risk losing coverage"
AskReddit,there are no prescription charges in scotland so while some prescriptions come with a cost in some parts of the uk its not in all 
AskReddit,deleted
AskReddit,i mean rich saudi princes and the like appear in german hospitals all the time as well
AskReddit,you were close it is good for one thing making medical companies and execs lots of money
AskReddit,yupp with that argument you could defend keeping the death camps open as otherwise the guards and torturers would be unemployed
AskReddit,i think a lot of the jobs have less to do with sales and more to do with navigating the maze that is medical insurance bullshit my sister in law works at a hospital and her sole job deals with billing negotiating and managing the tons of different insurance policies their patients have she doesnt even work for an insurance company but her job probably wouldnt exist without it shes in something like a 25 person department but if healthcare in the us were more sane and streamlined that department would probably be 4 or 5 people
AskReddit,"funny thing is when i worked for the toronto blue jays the players used the canadian healthcare over the mlb player association healthcare which would be the go to for any other team which shocked me being as the mlbpa healthcare is supposed to be one of the best in the country usa  the head athletic trainer basically said canadas healthcare system is top notch and it doesnt make sense using an inferior insurance

now maybe this was because it was for a player who got the flu and might not be the case for other types of care but still funny regardless"
AskReddit,our system up here definitely isnt perfect but ya ive never paid for a thing besides ordering food because i didnt feel like hospital meals its fairly remote where i live and when i busted my arm i had a cab to the airport and a medivac flight to winnipeg to get screws and plates put in 3 nights in the hospital then got put on a commercial flight home and out of all that my only expense was 35 bucks for a baggage fee it really blows me away how people can be against health care
AskReddit,"i remember my first experience of culture shock  i from the us was in canada riding a motorcycle around in my early 20s

got to chatting with some similar aged young ladies one of whom had a cast on her arm  i was in disbelief that it had cost her nothing to treat and they were in disbelief that a similar injury in the us would have bankrupted me"
AskReddit,"there was a recent post and im really sorry i cant find it now of a hospital that complied with this law they posted the price of each of their services from their original database exported as a csv file without any commas so basically a massive list of unreadable technical information that could not be understood by a normal person trying to learn anything but they could claim that they had shared the required information like the law said 

in general the majority of american doctors and nurses are decent skilled and caring people and absolutely every single one of the forprofit healthcare companies in the united states are rapacious bloodsucking parasites"
AskReddit," pay 14 of our income thats a lot

ive had jobs with employer provided health plans that cost me more than 14 of my income just to have the insurance and then still had to pay out of pocket pretty much anytime i needed health care  id absolutely take that"
AskReddit,14 is nothing if you consider the fact that employers have to contribute for all of their employees insurance plan through a group coverage rate thats on top of what i also have to contribute per paycheck looking at my recent tax return that number is absolutely insane compared to what i get in return
AskReddit,id have to do the math but im relatively sure im paying more than 14 for my health insurance which has a 5000 deductible before 8020 coverage kicks in
AskReddit,there are still problems with our system over here privategesetzliche kk but im fucking happy i dont have to contemplate if i can afford an ambulance or if i should get that bump checked out or just wait
AskReddit,"you hear something enough and you start to believe it a combination of facebook memes youtube videos talk radio and podcasts and right wing news as well as a grossly underfunded education system that in many places is discouraged from teaching critical thinking means you end up with a bunch of people who never hear anything good about universal healthcare and therefore support a system that costs them more money for their insurance which doesnt cover the full cost anyway and then pads out the costs further 

but the villain of the peace isnt universal healthcare its socialism many people dont want universal healthcare because they have been so thoroughly conditioned on the idea that socialism is bad and will lead to the wrong people getting help they previously did not at their expense that they would rather pay through the nose for coverage and treatment than lower their costs if it means that the wrong people dont get treated"
AskReddit,this 
AskReddit,tying healthcare to your job creates the benefit of if you stop working for us you have no healthcare which corporations looooove
AskReddit,my wife got cancer lymphoma late stage 2 but not stage 3 7 years ago 9 months of chemo and radiation treatment every 4 days we paid for parking everything else was covered by the norwegian government
AskReddit,a few years ago i had to take my 2 year old to the er as he had labored breathing turns out it was severe allergies we sat in a room for 45 minutes saw a np for 5 received a bottle of water and a steroid 800 bill and i had insurance and was at the hospital i actually worked at
AskReddit,i understand if out of pocket cost was 40 but 4000 reading similar stories here i dont understand why people are not permanently on the streets demanding universal health care
AskReddit,as a brit i just cant fathom how you yanks live like this truly mind boggling
AskReddit," is baffled that we dont have firearms in denmark

as a swedish sport shooter whos been to multiple handgun competitions in denmark you do have firearms in denmark its just not as easily accessible as in the us and owning one for selfdefense is not a valid reason this is the case for most of europe"
AskReddit,what baffles me is americans actually in belief that they could overthrow their government these are the same people who obsess over the us military and its insane capacity any organised armed resistance is going to be dealt with very quickly as soon as it even looks like an existential threat
AskReddit,i spent a bit of time looking it up but couldnt actually find out what kind of money you would expect to pay for specific treatments these charges were introduced in 2017 though so thats probably why you didnt hear about it actually hospitals get fined if they dont make an effort to recoup costs from nonresident patients imagine that in the us lol
AskReddit,no idea how its actually calculated but seemed to be 152x the cost of private care possibly more thinking back to how much basic ct scans etc could cost it popped up occasionally when i worked for the nhs  some families would bring their relatives to the uk for treatment assuming nhs would be cheaper even if they had to pay but it wasnt the case  private treatment in the uk is a heck of a lot cheaper than paying for nhs care the consultants always advised them to go private instead
AskReddit,emergencies that happen while you are in the uk are covered i think stuff you arrive with are not reasonably enough
AskReddit,"oh lord save me cuz canada is sounding too good not to go live in

ive already seen this kinda comment twice a traveler only paying 3035 for a visit to the hospital in canada and now this comment kinda confirming it

i used to work for a bit of an insurance company and id sometimes have to do travelers insurance claims and oh my absolute fucking god when i had to personally tell people their claim may not pan out or when i read the policies and realized how close they were to not being covered

i quit that job after a few months and now i fucking hate insurance companies"
AskReddit,"there were studys showing that the majority of all bankruptcies in the us was caused by medical debt

httpsajphaphapublicationsorgdoiabs102105ajph2018304901journalcodeajph

but of course in an unfunny twist in an age of misinformation it is behind a paywall"
AskReddit,and there was and continues to be a major push to eliminate bankruptcy  i had a coworker that had major healthcare costs when her son was born she was not working at the time and didnt have insurance she laughed about how the costs didnt matter after the first million she paid 15month towards the debt
AskReddit,dont get sick here in the us it will ruin not just you financially  but also your family
AskReddit,"reading these comments made me feel like it would be better to die than fight to live in america sorry for this opinion but this shit is just mental having to wait permission from insurance company or being nearly dead and live only to be told that insurance company desided to not pay for this

here both private and universal healthcare are options insurances are a thing and they direct you to private section never have i ever had to fight my insurance company for medical bills insuranse costs like 70100 per year"
AskReddit,i work on the government side of some of this and i can tell you that auditing these plans is a fucking nightmare the money is just all over the goddamn place you have to audit each program individually and some of the plans dont keep their data or just are unresponsive the government employees dont get to do whatever they want to figure things out proper authority has to be given in law and then interpreted and operationalized through regulations as a government employee in these matters i too want this broken system to be swept aside with something like medicare for all
AskReddit,"my father 1998 got sick he figured it was just a cold kept working got sicker thought maybe it was the flu stopped going into the 2 jobs he had that interacted with people but kept working the night shift dropping off big bundles of newspapers for stores and machines didnt want to get anyone else sick figured they might be like him no insurance still wouldnt go to the hospital didnt want to bankrupt the family with a huge bill hed seen it happen with his own father lung cancer from smoking and cirrhosis of the liver with his mother

third day they couldnt wake him up called an ambulance he was comatose pneumonia water filling up the pericardium applied so much pressure that his heart couldnt beat any longer he died less than 3 hours after arriving to the hospital at the age of 60

the last person to tell me that people in the us dont die from not having health insurance any more lost two teeth when i punched them in the mouth and im not sorry i was 30 when i lost my father to this bullshit he should have had another 20 years easy

universal health care now "
AskReddit,the system doesnt give a shit if he goes down fighting they dont care at all he cant show them anything thats why the system sucks it renders us powerless woo freedom s
AskReddit,my god at least us human beings know that you did the right thing
AskReddit,i was in a bed in the emergency room with atrial fibrillation and severe nausea when a lady with the hospital came in to ask me how i was going to pay my 300 copay i told her to get the fuck out
AskReddit,in a decent healthcare system they should be taking her to the closest hospital or if appropriate the best hospital for her particular medical condition stroke centres heart centres trauma specialists etc
AskReddit,thank you for doing that for him
AskReddit,deleted
AskReddit,"i once had a roommate who had cancer she never went into remission because her insurance would only cover up to a certain dollar amount in costs and she had no way to pay for additional treatments she literally had to wait until her annual coverage renewed to keep getting chemo and just cross her fingers and hope she didnt die before then

i live in massachusetts a state with a great healthcare system and almost universal coverage miles better than the rest of the country and she still had to live like that"
AskReddit,"for what its worth when i had cancer in my early 20s i only ended up paying around 1200 for my care that was my out of pocket maximum

its all just chanceluck though i happened to have a great health plan that covered what i needed i had been considering dropping to the cheapest plan because i was young really glad i didnt do that"
AskReddit,i dont understand it though nobody is paying them 3mil thats grounds for medical bankruptcy so why dont they support universal healthcare theyd get paid for at least every nonelective patients arent paying them those high prices but the government will and can be negotiated i also feel like universal healthcare could be a thing with lobbying from the healthcare system
AskReddit,indian guy here my mom did her chemo at the govt hospital in kerala which was as good as a private hospital if not better and had our total expenses at 14 lakh i love this country
AskReddit,"youre doctor ordered an mri and it was rejected by who  how is that even a thing

by some insurance fuck requiring prior authorization then rejecting it via an algorithm that tells him the doctor wanting the test is wrong that is no bullshit how this system works"
AskReddit,"french here my girlfriend needed an mri to rules out a potential cause for her illness dont know the english name

it was not a priority but she got a date a few days later

it costs us 80 which will be reimbursed

here in france the mutuel the organism that cover your health cost and reimburse you cost something around 40 for a single person each month

plus your mutuel is covered by your work they pay part of it for you and the rest is taken from your salary 

i just cant imagine for the life of me a world where i dont have this  universal healthcare should be a basic human right"
AskReddit," i pay 2400year in total for end to end healthcare for all four of us

in the us i pay 4200year to cover just me on an insurance plan that has a 3000 deductible at which point it covers 80 of my bills"
AskReddit,"you do pay in taxes

1 i already pay for it in taxes
2 then i pay for it again with my premium
3 finally i pay for it a third time with my deductible"
AskReddit,hey  doctor here yes it is insane basically the insurance company banks on us giving up by being overwhelmed by so many denials you have to pick and choose which ones you fight with every denial there is a phone number at the bottom of the page in tiny print where we can call for a peer to peer it connects us physicians to another physician employed by the insurance company nearly every time we get to this point that insurance company physician approves what we originally ordered but insurance companies know that with our burnout factory life structure we likely wont have time or energy to do it
AskReddit," youre doctor ordered an mri and it was rejected by who  how is that even a thing

my example is not nearly so extreme but twice this year my doctor said you need medication and my insurance said no you dont"
AskReddit,ditto  im actually lucky in that i got fullblown optic neuritis and lost sight in my left eye in a 25yearold its a telltale ms symptom so i had an mri within a week and a diagnosis within a month
AskReddit,private insurance also does help with a lot of dental chiropractic physio optical and other things like that however i certainly echo your sentiments that the libs need to stop lining the private health cares pockets and focus on making the public system better
AskReddit,sounds amazing
AskReddit,20 a day for food in mexico you can eat delicious tacos all day for like 7 max and thats for really good tacos more like 4 if youre eating average street tacos which are still delicious eat where the mexicans eat its better food and you wont pay tourist prices
AskReddit,"god damn i love our medicare system except the fact that it excludes dental

i had a dental abscess was hospitalised twice first time i even got a private room needed a shitload of antibiotics a whole truckload of painkillers and then surgery

i walked out a few days later paid 10 bucks for a couple of scripts"
AskReddit,even chile that is a capitalist heaven doesnt get health insurance from jobs i mean we get a if you get any sort of accident during your job we have you covered insurance within our contracts but that one is connected to ourselves not the job itself so i can change jobs 100 times and ill still have the same coverage attached to my own insurance
AskReddit,"constantly literally constantly to the point that theyll break themselves physically and mentally in the process because theyre desperate to have at least something to fall back on if they get sick only to lose their job because they pushed themselves too hard and now the company no longer sees them as useful and american employees have so few protections its like historys worst joke 

also if it seems complex thats because it is pointlessly needlessly complex overblown and practically worthless despite it all even good insurance these days can force you to pay multiple thousands of dollars before theyll cover anything and then stop covering anything if you need more the whole thing is set to fuck over anyone who tries to actually use it"
AskReddit,yes  this is probably the biggest reason people stay in a terrible job  to keep their insurance
AskReddit,"yup most people in the white collar world have good insurance and whatever white collar job they get will have good insurance but there are a lot of people in govt jobs generally very good insurance but lower pay or other jobs with good insurance who feel they cant leave because they have kids or take medications that are expensive out of pocket 

its crazy if they separated insurance from our jobs i bet a lot of people would quit and pursue something else"
AskReddit,"its quite common but i think its less common than it was before the passage of the affordable care act before the aca an insurer could deny coverage for certain visits and procedures if they were due to a preexisting condition if the condition newly occurred while you were on that policy you were fine but anything preexisting could be excluded 

my mom had breast cancer preaca she had a lot of surgeries and has to be on medication basically forever now the job that she had at the time she got sick was incredibly physically laborious and afterward she just couldnt do it anymore but she stayed because she knew that her 1500 a month medication that she had to take to prevent recurrence wouldnt be covered and that was all based on the assumption that she wouldnt have a recurrence if she did which her doctors said was more likely than not shed have been on her own to pay for that treatment too so she stayed and came home after work each day in tears from the pain

after the passage of the aca she was able to move to a new job that better fit the abilities of her new postcancer body she has good insurance and doesnt have to worry about going medically bankrupt should the unthinkable happen and her cancer come back im thankful every day for the removal of preexisting condition exclusions and i cant even believe that we have politicians who want to reverse that

shes 15 years cancer free now by the way"
AskReddit,my husbands vasectomy was the same way 3600 with insurance 2500 if you dont have it he asked what the difference would be if he paid cash at the time of the procedure in which it was 1400
AskReddit,"i actually got insanely lucky immediately after my ordeal with the hospital my partner and i got a kitten the kitten bonded with me because i wasnt able to leave the house by myself for a couple months after my c i probably would have lost my mind without my kitten 

also we had a great network of friends and family who checked in on us 

but back to my original point without double health insurance coverage we would have lost our house 

i dont understand how the fuck we live in the richest country in the world but have a healthcare system that has the potential to throw grieving parents on the street"
AskReddit,"its absolutely a scam the whole idea of american healthcare is fuckery and shenanigans

i pay  out of my own paycheck every week just in case something happens then when it does i cant use that money i have to spend my own money first and it resets every year and if i manage to get sick enough in a given year for the plan to have to pay they do everything they can to decline to pay for my care with my money that ive been giving them every week of my adult life"
AskReddit,i worked as a temp in a hospital billing office in college i learned from them to always ask for an itemized bill to see and dispute charges
AskReddit,damn i would have to lose a few decades and breach quarantine  but meerkats  id be there in a flash thats so nice
AskReddit,"i remember this hospital near me
it had a terrarium with turtles a iguana
a fish tank and i wonder if its still there"
AskReddit,"wait a meerkat habitat the only thing we here in germany get in a kids hospital are disney characters painted on the walls xd

edit mainly because we do not have dedicated childrens hospitals at least as far as i know most hospitals do have a kids ward though but not as amazing as this one"
AskReddit," the meerkat habitat that the kids can see the meerkats

ironic that even in a universal healthcare institution there is still a department of insurance salesmen"
AskReddit,just the helicopter ride would be enough to completely cripple a family enough that some people would be asking if the kid was stable enough to make a 45 hour car ride shit is scary
AskReddit,"that one happened 2 years ago and unfortunately its an eternal guillotine above my head i wake up every day knowing that this is probably going to kill me im only 28

it gets more complicated but without being too verbose i pretty much cant work and cant get disability so i cant even participate in what little medical care most americans do have access to

i dont even have reliable access to the medications i need to keep this at bay if it gets bad enough ill have to learn how to brew digitalis in place of proper beta blockers after i run out already ran out of everything else

id give anything to have what you guys have way too many americans feel exactly the same way"
AskReddit,getting stabbed by a bear seems awful

AskReddit,yeap those of us in the us with seizure disorders tend to wear on their bracelet i am fine do not call an ambulance for years in first aid training id point that it when they got to the instructions of dealing with seizure disorders i guess enough people had the same complaint because this year it was actually part of my training to assess whether an ambulance was necessary or not for a seizure
AskReddit,you understand it perfectly its garbage
AskReddit,even the insurance companies dont know ive heard from many friends who call their insurance for a small question and they keep transferring them to different departments for hours no one fucking knows how insurance and healthcare works in the us thats how bad it is
AskReddit,"im pretty sure insurance looks at what you got then decides if they want to pay for it or not or if your plan even covers what you needed 

not health but dental i had a real bad cavity on one of my teeth that had to have a cap on it neither my moms or dads insurance wanted to cover it said it wasnt needed even though i basically didnt have a tooth left ended up being about 700"

AskReddit,i could barely find a dentist in my area who both 1 takes my insurance and 2 accepts new patients same with a doctor gotta use an urgent care clinic every time and all they have are nurses and maybe a pa there
AskReddit,yep i needed a heart procedure they scheduled me 4 months out youd think with the rhetoric in america id be having it the following week
AskReddit,seriously it takes at least a couple months around here to see most specialists like i got referred to a anesthesiologistpain management first appointment wasnt until end of october another dr in practice can see me beginning of october rheumatology im not expecting to be able to get an appointment until like november
AskReddit,you dont live in a rich area thats the problem right there walletus deficitus

AskReddit,that and the healthcare system that self sabotages every attempt at moving forward by under hiring over working and loyalty to stockholders
AskReddit,brother i know everyone is sick of hearing it if they can afford to pump trillions into afghanistan fighting a ponzi war they can afford healthcare idk anymore wallah
AskReddit,"i spoke to an acquaintance in the us about universal healthcare they were adamant that they didnt want their tax dollars paying for other peoples care

because they were under the impression that healthcare actually costs that much 

it doesnt its just insurance companies and hospitals that are royally ripping people off"
AskReddit,and they try to use the enormous cost of it all to justify the way things are now without realizing that the cost of universal healthcare would be less than what the us is currently paying for healthcare
AskReddit,"as a canadian i was sad when that bill got shot down by cory booker of all people could you imagine the negotiating power canada would have with the drug companies if the entire usa was biggybacking off our procurements

also why the hell cant the usa negotiate themselves for bloody sake  ridiculous levels of corruption on display for that policy even to be suggested let alone fail"
AskReddit, yeah same with private prisons think of the jobs the prisoners being paid pennies would lose s
AskReddit,my last job was at a 100 person company whose sole purpose was doing billing exclusively for like a dozen radiology practices across the country we had tens of millions of dollars going through our little outfit every year a large portion of our work was manually correctingfindingverifying patents insurance information printing thousands of pages of paper a week to send to insurance companies that are stuck in the 20th century and reresending appeals to insurance companies who denied claims for the tiniest of reasons just soooo so much waste going on there absolutely none of it would have been necessary in the country i live in now estonia
AskReddit,"yep but on the flip side there would be many more jobs in the government side of management as well as in the overall healthcare system that would replace them more people will be able to and will go to doctors and urgent care facilities if they know it wont cost them to get checked out  


jobs move across industries as time marches on as usual"
AskReddit,"as somebody who grew up in the us and moved to canada about 7 years ago i cant tell the difference in care hospitalsclinics wait times and standard of care all have been the same to me  the only difference not worrying about the cost

had appendicitis last year had to have surgery and an overnight in the hospital cost 0  
wife had a baby 5 years ago cost 50 upgrade to a semiprivate room"
AskReddit,because its been deeply ingrained into the american pysche that doing something to help your fellow citizens without profit effectively equals communism and communism is the devil
AskReddit,"ya our system still needs improvement like dental prescription meds etc but its better than nothing 

i once had a severe leg break from skiing 2 major surgeries to screw it back together and 10 days in hospital and then they said ok you can go now 0"
AskReddit,i honestly dont know how yall do it i imagine many people commit suicide because they cant deal with their pain and crippling debt
AskReddit,the illusion of insurance
AskReddit,quickly ran the numbers and yeah between the employer and my payroll contribution im not that different from that number and thats for my 1000 deductible6000 outofpocket plan i maxed the outofpocket last year
AskReddit,or the whole this doctor does not accept my insurance issue it seems insane to be in a hospital but only half of the staff are willing to look at you
AskReddit,its so sad people think theres is such a thing as the wrong people getting healthcare everyone should have the right to helthcare
AskReddit,"socialism

i find it ironic that gofundme is responsible for funding so much medical debt in the country who cant stand the idea of socialist values"
AskReddit,healthcare as a benefit keeps people trapped in jobs and many employers love knowing that they have another bargaining chip to prevent people quitting or asking for things above their station
AskReddit,"would be the same in denmark are you guys as pissed about having to pay for parking as danes are thats a whole thing here apparently

were doing too well"
AskReddit,a lot of people are ignorant and dont realize its an issue until its too late and someone in their family has a problem
AskReddit,tbh tho 150 is probably still cheaper someone should make an industry over there selling insurance to americans  for cheaper than american health insurance lol plane tickets covered with the insurance consider me subscriber 1
AskReddit,its available through scihubst
AskReddit,i wonder how that stat would change if student loans werent exempt from bankruptcy though
AskReddit,"in a just world yes i work 911 i take people where they ask to go if they are unconscious they go to closest appropriate if they ask to go to a hospital that isnt well equipped for their injury then i tell them if they insist i have to take them where they want to go shit i dont even know what insurance covers where

more than likely the emts worked for a private service that was probably disciplining emts for not getting insurance info"
AskReddit,not just cancer i went in for a routine checkup that shouldve been covered but my dr ordered a cholesterol check which bills it as a consult visit  in the end it cost me over 300 and i had to miss half a day of work to do it since i work 3 counties away from my dr  all in all i was out about 550 for my annual checkup which should be covered
AskReddit,would choose life there is no way i could live with 1 million debt
AskReddit,thank god i live in denmark
AskReddit,in canada everyone complains about having to pay parking at the hospital
AskReddit,that can only happen in kerala no surprises
AskReddit,i have had medical care in india several times and was surprised at how cheap it was so cheap i did not bother to claim my insurance but unfortunately those sort of prices are still not affordable for all people there especially the more expensive ones for severe health issues the price you mentioned might not be affordable for someone in the slums
AskReddit,"i cannot fathom how a distinct private organisation can challenge the use of diagnostic tests ordered by a medical officer and delayprevent it

that sounds absolutely absurd to me and its disgusting how hospitals have to fight with insurance companies over what constitutes as necessary treatment but i guess thats just symptomatic of a broken system

x200b

how this is in any way defensible is something that i will never be able to comprehend"
AskReddit,holy shit  because a medical professional with over a decade of training and experience feels its necessary but some random insurance clerk disagrees and your fucked  thats insane
AskReddit,cant believe i get money taken out of my paycheck every two weeks for the luxury of the insurance company to tell us no you cant get that test or surgery because our risk algorithm says you arent worth it
AskReddit,and use spanish most likely because less touristy usually means less english help settings from what i understand
AskReddit,our car insurance is also designed to fuck over anyone who actually uses it regardless of whos at fault
AskReddit,it also is likely the number one reason people dont retire early
AskReddit,yes it is one of the greatest strains on entrepreneurship in this country

AskReddit,"i was unfortunate enough to be pregnant and uninsured for my second pregnancy for whatever reason 36000 for an unmedicated complicationfree child birth im pretty sure i was doing all the work was what i was going to be expected to pay unless i paid ahead of time if i prepaid it went down to 6500 

my first pregnancy i had tricare best insurance i ever had and it is the sole reason i support at the very least government subsidized insurance for everyone"
AskReddit,cat tax my kitten when she turned 3  httpsimgurcomgalleryoyse2kg
AskReddit,whole hospital is under 16 yo only
AskReddit,"i had a hospital visit in may that involved a 100 mile medical helicopter ride after 3 hours spent trying to stabilise me at the accident site a 10 hour spinal surgery 3 ct scans at least a dozen chest xrays a week in the high dependency unit and another week on the major trauma ward

total cost to me directly well i had to get a taxi home from the hospital after i got out that was it

its crazy to think that incident would have bankrupted me easily had it happened in the states"
AskReddit,this might sound stupid but wouldnt it be possible for you to leave the us and go live in a country where you get the healthcare you need it might very well give you the ability to live a better less stressfull life
AskReddit,this is horrendous absolutely unacceptable im in the uk and while we dont take it for granted and we all support the nhs it is really ordinary for us to have free care i get a text once a month to remind me to order my medication and my husbands and they text again when its ready and we go pick it up for free because hes over 65 and i only work part time when he had to have his gall bladder out we called an ambulance and they took him in for a week did his operation he stayed in a single en suite room that was bigger than the room we last went on holiday to with his own tv and it cost us nothing at all except we paid 20 for a taxi home as no one could drive hes been on free medication since then 3 years ago i sincerely hope your country makes some proper changes that protect you from going through this ever again
AskReddit,nah the insurance companies know how it works they just dont want to explain it or it gets even more blatant how absurdly broken the system is and how they just act as middle men
AskReddit,at the end of the day someone will pull all the threads and discover its just a randomized algorithm

AskReddit,"cause that would mean hed pay for somebodys ovarian cancer treatments for example and he doesnt have ovaries so it would be paying for something that doesnt benefit him

i heard this is a very common american way of thinking ie why should i pay for a stranger they can pay for their own stuff  boggles my mind"
AskReddit,same but for a child in mental health crisis very little is as powerless feeling as your kid needing to see someone now but the next availability is months out for a therapist who takes children and your insurance
AskReddit,"i got lucky i dont have insurance i had a cracked molar for a few years and it finally got infected and became an emergency could have had universal healthcare could have gotten it out all those years any time non emergency but waited until i couldnt work or eat or talk and crying in pain was all i could do i got in same day terrified because my last attempt to get it out caused me to black out gave me nitris 2 hours later and 500 it was finally out i put it on care credit interest free 

the amount if things we could prevent if caught early and dealt with before it becomes an emergency is staggering it ends up costing far more in the end 

i support paying more out of my paycheck to go towards universal healthcare my situation was minor but just a fleeting example of how early treatment for literally everything is the better cheaper approach"
AskReddit,i live in a very wealthy county had very good insurance and still had to wait 6months to be seen by a specialist this was 4 years ago dont even know what its like now havent had time to see a doctor since
AskReddit,"hello quiet american here with my quiet wife weve packed our bags and have sold our house where exactly should we buy a ticket for 

for real though we would move in a heart beat if there was a country with quality healthcare and would have us"
AskReddit,hey its me your newly adopted 30 year old american son
AskReddit,hard habit to break we clap when we land to thank the pilot for not causing us to be sent to the hospital each successful landing prevents a hundred bankruptcies
AskReddit,just the helicopter flight would be over 6 figures 
AskReddit,my dad was in a car wreck and had to be helicoptered the trip was less than a mile but it cost 250000 usd after all the medical bills for him and my mom it was about 500000 insurance wouldnt cover the helicopter and only covered like 20 of the bills the driver that hit him ditched the truck and ran away the owner of the car reported the truck stolen the next day so that their insurance wouldnt take a hit
AskReddit,the pharmaceutical corporations that buy off politicians doesnt help as well they dont see people with cancer as patients but instead customers
AskReddit,it isnt self sabotage it is excelling at delivering its intended result  shareholder returns
AskReddit,but universal healthcare helps people not corporations so thats why they dont pull the trigger companies like raytheon and lockheed martin own this country
AskReddit,people never seem to grasp that if their taxes go into helping others others taxes go into helping them its honestly a mindboggling concept to them
AskReddit,thats how you know our country is full of morons theyre so selfish to the point of being anti helping their fellow man because that equals communism and that equals taking away mah freedums yet these dipshits get hurt or sick and where do they go gofundme damn near every american on gofundme is there to beg strangers for help with medical bills theyre literally too fucking dumb to comprehend that instead of proposing a socially responsible medical system theyd rather beg for socially funded aid we live in a country of selfish troglodytes
AskReddit,"not just that but also that taxes are bad no one wants to pay more taxes absolutely no one even though taxes are how shit gets paid for    

and europeans are supposedly insane for having high taxes pretty sure their taxes are less than the money i owe for health care 

socialism is supposedly evil too smh"
AskReddit,are you serious it costs me 400 bucks to go to the doctor and get pills every 4 months i feel like im in an abusive relationship  fuck
AskReddit,deleted
AskReddit,now my wife and i are selfemployed  when we shopped for health insurance the cheapest plan we could find was 500month to have a 17000 deductible  so in addition to paying 500month we also had to pay the first 8500 of our healthcare every year each  and then after that 8500 per year each theres still copays and coinsurance  better off taking that 500 and burning it in a trash can for warmth every month
AskReddit,i feel weird complaining about it infront of americans that go into massive debt over an xray when it cost us less than 5 to park at the hospital but yes those parking fees was the worst
AskReddit,insurance companies already are doing that its called medical tourism
AskReddit,lolwut people request their preferred hospital while waiting for an ambulance  here you get taken to the nearest hospital with a free bed regardless of any other factor
AskReddit,my grandfathers successful cancer treatment cost 3 lakhs in a private hospital here in karnataka no idea what it wouldve cost in govt hospital
AskReddit,"its to reduce waste and fraud implying that it is the providers who are over billing or billing incorrectly to make money

the reality is were ordering stuff because were not sure and dont want to be sued later yes the patient really does need that surgery and yes the patient really does need that medication and the approved medications arent appropriate

not to say there isnt fraud and abuse but i doubt enough to saddle every provider and their staff with extra work and then create worse outcomes at least for my part of the healthcare sector i can be audited by the insurance company and they will take money from me if they find something wrong

hospital bills are huge in the us partly to make up for the fact there are so many who walk into the er without insurance and then cant pay the bill so they charge as much as they can to make up for it americans who shriek about not wanting to pay for someones poor choices dont realize they are already doing it in the least efficient and most expensive way possible"
AskReddit,yep or worse before we got married my wife was on her parents insurance which wouldnt pay for testing unless it yielded a diagnosis
AskReddit,lets be clear this isnt the fault of an individual or a group of people who are bad at making decisions related to medical concerns  the american system is literally designed to be profitable over functional insurance companies call cancer a preexisting condition and deny to pay for treatment because you already had it before they became liable for you the best example of how fucked the system is would be death panels the crazy right wing in the us has frequently claimed over the last twenty years or so that if single payer or universal healthcare were implemented it would result in a death panel in the government choosing if people get treatment or die in reality insurers already do this and frequently deny treatments especially for elderly or otherwise atrisk patients in order to save money
AskReddit,it really blows my mind that 1 you guys havent burned everything yet and that 2 any intention of changing the system is met with urr this is socialismcommunismwhatever
AskReddit,this thread had me thinking how ironic this all is americans especially the crowd that is typically against universal healthcare conservativesthe right claim they love entrepreneurship but our health insurance system makes it 10x harder scarier and more stressful than it needs to be
AskReddit,tricare is by far the best insurance i have ever had not being a member of congress myself it is the sole reason i didnt get out of the army at 20 years a wife and kids with health problems get expensive if you have to meet a 10000 deductible
AskReddit,i missed giving birth under tricker coverage by three weeks and wound up with a different insurance company it costs us 3000 buying tricare coverage for 3 months was also 3000 at the time so we said f it

AskReddit,i dont know about other countries but new zealand figured out that trick in the oh 90s when the public found out that pregnant american women were coming here for holidays a month before their due date and using the basically free health service nonresidents dont get access to many of our free health services now
AskReddit,this it works by making the companies that own the insurance firms humongous profits they do this by doing absolutely everything they can to never ever pay out any money

AskReddit,might as well go out with style and make it look accidental  my plan is to take just a little bit too much heroin  supposedly the first time you do heroin is a euphoric experience  not a bad way to die since i wont be alive for the addiction part

AskReddit,if any of you should happen to work in healthcare or education we might just be having some good socialist space for you in norway but if you sit next to anyone on a bus with otherwise empty seats you will be expelled

AskReddit,"when i was a stupid kid i fell about 8 to 10 meters and landed with my back on a sidewalk edge

helicopter was on its way but the ambulance was faster police blocked every intersection on the way to the hospital during rush hour

my parents didnt get a single bill i only had bruises and a hairline fraction btw but they had thought i had a broken spine which is why they went all out getting me to the hospital

its just insane to me that my parents wouldve been in some deep debt had we live in the usa its just ridiculous what happened to your dad"
AskReddit,"how about an eleven day stay in hospital with complications that will require life long monitoring and a protracted end of life ten years in and the total bill so far 0  gotta love the nhs

i fee sorry for most americans when it comes to health care many seem to be paying absolute top dollar for health care and getting third rate service at best i mean youve got great doctors and treatments but many cant access them i would bet that if you set up state health care it would cost less both overall and individually and provide better care on average the only people that would lose out are the very rich as they would likely pay for both state and private medical"
AskReddit,states have statutes of limitations on medical debt theyll absolutely still take your money out even harass you but when the debt hits the statute of limitations you legally dont have to pay it in my state its 3 years itll affect your credit for 7 but it sounds like thats the least of her worries please make sure shes checked the statute
AskReddit,damn that sucks is she allowed to make decent money and just pay the bare minimum or does the majority of her income get taken and leave her living poor
AskReddit,"my insurance only covers one specific hospital in my area i would be royally fucked if i were in an accident or something and they took me to a different hospital

not only would my insurance not pay for anything but theres even a clause in there that states going to a different hospital outside their network violates their policy and they reserve the right to cancel our entire policy with them 

they also dont cover any pharmaceuticals so i cant even take one drug that im supposed to because i dont have 600 extra a month to spend on it"
AskReddit,your second point is the result of the intentional division of the workers by the corporations and billionaires and thats why your first point hasnt happened yet
AskReddit,"the second point is bang on as far as i seehear americans are other americans worst enemy too many conflate freedom with selfishness

the middle classes who play this stupid game superficially break even or are too entrenched in the system brain washed by the last 40 years of murica is the greatest to see theres an issue  
those two effects lead to them perceiving the system is fair and its only the poor who are complaining because they cant get something for nothing and all they need to do is play the game and their dreams will come true

this sentiment is prevalent in the uk too where homeless people and poor families are told to just get a job as if its that easy or as if that would even solve the issues"
AskReddit,this is the part that boggles my mind my father became an adult in the early to mid 50s during the period where the us had the best social safety net its ever had i wont list everything off but he directly benefitted from it in several ways not even accounting for the way the taxes incentivized the people at the top of a company to reinvest in both the company itself and the wagesbenefits of its workers recently he has decided that any and all of the attempts to reintroduce or rebuild the policies and programs that built his success are all radical new socialist plots even ones that are literal carbon copies of policies from his time
AskReddit,be sure to cut belarus out of the map before doing that though
AskReddit,"my gf went to the er once via ems the closest hospital sent a nice bill for 8k that was after insurance btw it was out of network  she couldnt really speak so couldnt tell them where she needed to go

next time for the same exact thing but i happened to be around to take her caught it earlier so i got her before ems would actually be needed i got her to her in network hospital a 1k bill instead

want to know the kicker

the out of network hospital has an entire health system in our state all of their family med offices and various specialist locations are covered but not their ers and hospital facilities

so for her nonemergencyhospitalization needs she has one health system and for the other she uses a different health system even more annoying is that their hospitals the in and out of network ones tend to be located next to each other most times or at most 5 mins away"
AskReddit,"i discovered not just bikes a few days ago hes a youtube channel that criticises usas urban planning and compares it to other countries mostly netherlands and one of his biggest critiques is that most of the us people have grown up in a model that makes them unable to see somewhere else to compare so they assume that everything it is as it is and thats the one model it applies to urban planning healthcare and many other social issues

i dont know mate if it works in finland japan taiwan germany and so many other placesperhaps its worth checking it out"
AskReddit,its honestly impressive and super depressing how effective american capitalism is at crushing peoples imagination like large swaths of the populace literally can not even imagine a better system
